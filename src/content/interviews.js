    title: `William Liu`,
    subtitle: `Kam Wai Dim Sum`,
    blurb: `William Liu is the owner and operator of Kam Wai Dim Sum, a frozen dim sum company located at 249 East Pender. Kam Wai has been serving the Chinatown community for almost 30 years, and is one of the last places in Chinatown where one can grab a delicious and filling hot lunch at an accessible price. The shop front is unassuming, and though the menus on the walls have been overwritten time and time again to reflect changes in available items and their fluctuating prices, just one bite of their mushroom chicken rice can transport you to a singular yet undefinable moment in time where nostalgia lives. It was important for us to speak with William because it’s legacy businesses like Kam Wai that give Chinatown its unique flavour. William chats with us about what it’s like to grow up in Chinatown, to be a queer Chinese man, and the everyday memories that he continues to make and to treasure.

    content: `*CT:  Can you tell us a bit about your relationship with Chinatown?
    *
    *W: Chinatown is special to me because I grew up here on Keefer, right across from Strathcona, and I lived there until I was 29. My parents have had businesses in Chinatown since before I was born, so I was literally born into Chinatown. That’s why it’s so special for me to do business here. It’s just coming back to my roots. 
    *
    *CT:  How long has Kam Wai been on Keefer?*
    *W: Kam Wai was established in 1991. My family had different ventures before Kam Wai as well. My dad’s first venture was a bakery on Keefer Street called 龍鳳茶餐廳 (Long Fong Cafe). After that, my parents veered away from the food business, and they had a Chinese antique and jewelry shop at 545 Gore. Then Kam Wai came after.*
    *CT:  What is your fondest memory of being in Chinatown?*
    *W: Growing up, my parents wanted me to go to Chinese school. The only school that had Chinese lessons was St. Francis Xavier, which is on Princess Avenue. After Chinese school, which ended at 4:30PM, I would run straight to where my mom worked, and I would sit down with her, and just drink coffee and have baked goods. Normally that would happen at a place like Goldstone. The fondest memory for me is going straight from school to see my mom and grab a bite to eat. It was an everyday ritual for me. That was literally the first meal of the day for my mom, and I got to spend that time with her every single day. It brought me joy everyday.*
    *CT:  Do you still have the first meal with your mom now?*
    *W: Yeah, that still happens every day. We have that tradition. I still go with my mom to 飲咖啡 (drink coffee) around 3:30PM.*
    *CT:  One of the key focuses of this publication is intangible heritage. When you think about Chinatown, are there other ways intangible heritage comes out?*
    *W: There are so many intangible elements in Chinatown that I can’t even explain. Just being here in itself is an experience. Growing up, I remember walking through the crowds when it was bustling here. The sounds you would hear, it was just so memorable. I can still hear it in my mind. People yelling at each other, except they weren’t yelling at each other, it was just so loud you had to yell to be heard. And it was such an experience growing up around that. I used to remember all the gonggong popos who would always have candy in their pouches. As a child, you call everybody gonggong and popo, and they would give you candy when you sweet talk them. So I’ve learned to always say hi to your elders and be nice to them, because you’ll get something sweet in return. When you’re walking through the crowds, there are so many smells. The butchers, the seafood mongers, all that fresh seafood. You can also smell the roasted pork going through.Those memories will always stay with me. They’re not something that can be recreated, because you just don’t see or hear that many people in Chinatown anymore, and that's sad.*
    *CT:  Kam Wai used to have many more dim sum chefs. What’s changed?*
    *W: This, to me, ties into the decline of foot traffic in Chinatown. In the early 90s, when Kam Wai first opened, we had a good 20 chefs here working until close to midnight. Dim Sum chefs will typically work in their own restaurants from 7 AM to 3 PM, and they have the rest of the day off. We would have had people come in at 3:30 PM, and work until 11 PM or 12 AM at night just to keep up with the demand for our products. At the time frozen dimsum was still really new, and it was super convenient, and people knew it was freshly made the day of, especially with the buns. I remember the buns would come out of the steamer, and people would grab them out of the steam trays. They were piping hot, and as a child, I thought it was hilarious, watching adults grab plastic bags and shoving buns into them. That’s a fun memory, seeing people fight over a 叉燒包 (BBQ pork bun). *
    *CT:  What does resilience mean to you?*
    *W: For me, resilience is trying to put a positive spin on things. It’s easy to dwell on the past because there were so many great moments in the past. But with gentrification and everything else, you really need to push through and have a positive outlook. There are still businesses out here that thrive, and continue to thrive, like Kam Wai. There are countless others that continue to thrive, trying their best to do well, even through the COVID-19 pandemic. I think really it’s just about trying your best to be positive throughout time.*
    *CT:  Can you tell us about your decision to take over Kam Wai when you had wanted to pursue a Masters degree in opera performance? *
    *W: [laughs and sighs] It was a tough decision to make, but at the time it was very easy. My dad had been going through dialysis for a few years, and he had the opportunity to get a new kidney. He was considering selling off the business, because he wouldn’t have been able to take on all the stress of work while in recovery. My dad asked me if I was willing and able to take over. At the time, I was auditioning everywhere in the United States. I put everything down because family is everything to me. It was a personal sacrifice that makes it easier for everyone else in the family, and it means everything to me. If I sacrifice a little bit, it doesn’t detract from anything in my life. I did a lot of training in opera, and it still lives on in me. But there’s a lot of travel that comes with opera, and I’d see way less of my family. I always knew in the back of my mind that the family business would be a backup plan for me, so I always knew that if something had come up in the family, or if opera didn’t work out as a career, I would always have Kam Wai. My family has always been in full support of that. I’m very happy with my decision. My dad is extremely healthy now, he has a new kidney, and he’s way less stressed than he was before because I’ve taken the bulk of the work here.*
    *CT:  What you said about giving up everything for the family strikes me as such a Chinese and filial thing to say.*
    *W: It’s kind of silly when I think about it, but it makes so much sense to me. I guess it really is a cultural thing, isn’t it? Sometimes I wonder if anyone else does this for their family. I grew up with two thing*S: from my mom, it was always to be a useful person, and from my dad it was nothing is impossible. They’d say it in Chinese, so my mom would say “要做有用人”, and my dad would say “總會有辦法”. I really took these to heart, and always just want to be the best son and best person I could be for everybody. The other thing is you always want to make your parents proud of you. I’m a proud queer man, and I’ve always wanted my parents to be extra proud of me. I’ve always wanted to work extra hard to make them realize that I can still be the son they wanted me to be, as if to make up for it. I know that they are proud of me, and that I’m exactly where they want me to be, but it’s just something that’s always in the back of my mind. It’s the guilt.*
    *CT:  How has your relationship to Chinatown changed from when you were a child to now, as a business owner? *
    *W: When I was a kid, I was just playing around having lunch with my mom. Now I see it as an opportunity to reconnect with the seniors who I met throughout the years. We have so many seniors that come by. They recognize me, and they would tell me they used to go to Long Fong and 飲茶，飲咖啡 (drink tea, drink coffee) with my grandfather. These memories really bring me back and ground me, and make me realize how important Chinatown is to me. I feel like it should be a special place for everybody. *
    *CT:  Speaking of seniors, throughout quarantine, Kam Wai was making dim sum items for the seniors that live in the May Wah Hotel. Can you tell us more about this?*
    
    *W: Food security in Chinatown is already so precarious, and to be able to get food in Chinatown at affordable prices is becoming more and more difficult. I wanted to be part of the program right away, and I wanted to be able to provide the seniors with a meal that was memorable and that could sustain them throughout the day. We made meals three times a day for a month and a half. I thought it was very successful, and we are happy to be part of it. Sometimes we would make 鹹魚豬肉飯 (salted fish and pork over rice), or other meals I thought they could eat without too much effort and that they would enjoy. It’s a meal I remember eating as a child with my grandparents. It’s such a simple meal, but it is so satisfying because of all the flavours. 
    
    *CT:  In what ways have you seen Chinatown change throughout COVID-19? Are there changes in your clientele, or how you market yourself? *
    *W: At the very beginning, Chinatown was a ghost town. There was nobody here, and businesses were suffering from that. Then after a month, people started coming back out, and there were fewer seniors, which was nice, because it meant they were staying home. I saw a lot of customers that were buying our frozen products for their parents and grandparents, which was fantastic. April through May were very busy months for us. People were buying out everything on our shelves everyday, looking to fill their freezers, afraid they wouldn’t be able to come out for a while. There have been a lot of closures in Chinatown, and a lot of new businesses have opened up, and they’re businesses that I don’t feel like fit the character of Chinatown. Ever since starting to do business here, I don’t feel like I should be judging people for doing business in Chinatown, but what I can say is that businesses here should have more of an ethical view on Chinatown, and be able to take responsibility for the aftereffects of their businesses. Of course anybody can do business here, but I feel like everybody should have a mindset that can support the seniors in Chinatown and other people that live here. You owe it to them that you can do business here. You also have to be able to provide something that’s affordable for the people that live in Chinatown. *
    *CT:  What are some ways that Kam Wai can be supported in this time, throughout the pandemic, and whatever the future of Chinatown might look like?*
    *W: I want people to be educated, and for them to learn about Chinatown. I want people to experience Chinatown firsthand. I want them to visit businesses, to talk to business owners, ask them how they’re doing, look at their customers, and try to take it in. I want people to just experience Chinatown and see the folks in Chinatown. I guess that’s not really supporting Kam Wai in particular.*
    *CT:  It sounds more like supporting Chinatown as a whole, which is brilliant. What has been your biggest worry throughout the pandemic, and what are the ways in which you’ve been working through it?*
    *W: Business-wise, our sales have dropped significantly. In the last five to six years, our business has been going more in the direction of wholesales because the foot traffic in Chinatown just can’t sustain us through retail. Because of the pandemic, wholesale has dropped significantly, and we’ve had to rely on our retail business. Through the first two months, it was great because retail was doing fine, but now it’s slowed down a lot and has gone back to what it was before the pandemic. Our wholesale has dropped by 70% throughout COVID-19. We’ve been trying to build an online platform for people to at home so they can do store and curbside pickup, rather than having to come in and dig through everything. We may do a home delivery system in the future if there’s a demand for it.*
    *CT:  What is your favourite item at Kam Wai, and is a must-try?*
    *W: Our 蝦餃 (shrimp dumplings) is the most popular item that sells out the quickest. We only have a limited amount everyday because it’s the most difficult item to make. Our 粽 (sticky rice dumplings) is our second most popular item. We make and sell a lot of it, especially in June during 粽 (sticky rice dumpling) season, both for our own retail and for other retailers. It’s something that gonggong and popos come here all the time to buy because it’s so labour-intensive, and nobody wants to make it at home. It really is a lot of work. *
    *CT:  Speaking of sticky rice dumplings, what does resilience mean to you having had this conversation?*
    *W: Resilience means being in the moment, and being able to take it in. Yes, we have to fight through things, but sometimes I feel like we have to have more of a positive outlook in order to bounce back, be able to pull through, and look forward to the future. To have a future, we have to be in the moment and try our best to make the best out of our current situation. As hard as it is, I know my family is trying our hardest to keep things alive in Chinatown, and we’re trying our hardest to keep everyone happy through our business and through our product. That’s as much as I really could do right now.`,

    blurb: `Emily Dundas Oke wears many hats. She is the curator and media manager at Massy Books, an Indigenous owned and operated bookstore located at 229 East Georgia Street. She is also the Arts Editor and Community Engagement Coordinator with the Capilano Review, and a co-organizer of the Indigenous Brilliance reading and performance series. Emily chats with Chinatown Today about Indigenous ways of knowing outside of colonial thought, and how art can act as resistance against the all consuming machine that is late stage capitalism. On a lighter, and perhaps more utilitarian note, Emily also reminds us that if we look under the right lens, even the flower patterns on toilet paper can become a source of artistic inspiration.
    `,
    title: `Emily Dundas Oke`,
    subtitle: `Massy Books`,
    content: `*CT:  Do you mind introducing yourself by telling us your name and a bit about who you are?
    *E: I am Emily Dundas Oke, and I am the curator and media manager at Massy Books. I also work with the Capilano Review as the Arts Editor and Community Engagement Coordinator. I am Cree, Metis, and Scottish. I grew up mostly in Secwepemcúl̓ecw, the unceded territories of the Secwepemc people. I moved to Vancouver, which is Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-waututh territories, two years ago. Since moving there, I’ve found a very welcoming community of creatives in the visual arts. Because there’s such a beautiful connection between visual arts and creative writing communities in Vancouver, I’ve also been welcomed into literary spaces over the last year and a half, predominantly through my work in galleries, but also through the art collective Indigenous Brilliance. I began organizing within the community with Patricia, the owner of Massy Books, about a year and a half ago. We started the Indigenous Brilliance Reading Series, which is a collaboration between Massy Books and Room Magazine. From there, Patricia invited me to work for Massy Books as well as the Massy Arts Society. I spend most of my time in writing and visual arts spaces. I find there are a lot of folks in Vancouver who value collaboration in the same way I do. It’s a space where people are always trying new endeavours together, so I’m really grateful for that. 
    *CT:   Why is Chinatown as a space special to you?
    *E: I think as an Indigenous person who’s never lived on territories I could call my own, I recognize that in a certain sense, I enact displacement. There’s also the histories of racialized peoples in Canada intersecting with one another, and I think an alliance between these communities through anti-colonial work is a necessary way forward to seek justice. Chinatown is a space that asks you to really question your own political opinions, and asks you to enact them as well. I’m still learning what it means to be anti-oppressive in this space, which I think is not just being a good neighbour, but also being cognizant of our role in occupation. On the more aesthetic and day-to-day realities side, it’s a place that has a really special history. I think we recognize that the history needs to be maintained, so it asks us to be thoughtful as we find a nice balance between holding on to the old while also making space for new things to emerge.
    *CT:  What does resilience mean to you?
    *E: I’ve seen companies that are not Indigenous-owned slap resilience as a logo on shirts to sell to Indigenous people, and that’s kind of funny to me. I find that resilience is used in marketing quite a lot, which has changed how I view the word and how it’s used. Someone had pointed out to me that resilience isn’t always the best term, because all it means is that they can still knock us down and we’ll still be standing. In this situation, is it better to focus on the person who can withstand these forms of violence, or should we be focused more on resurgence, as a coming back and moving away from that which asks people to be resilient? It’s only in places of harm where people need to practice resilience. I’d rather move away from the harm and focus on the good. Maybe that’s what people mean when they say resilience, which is not a necessary toughness, but the ability to come back. In some sense, I view resilience as the old ways still coming to life. Sometimes that means they change, and they’re fluid, but that oldness is still present. I think that’s a beautiful thing, but I hope we’d have fewer systems that demand those people to harden and strengthen in “resilient” ways. The Hawaiian epistemologist Manulani Aluli Meyer speaks about Indigenous wisdom using holographic science, and one thing she talks about is the idea of “old and (k)new” instead of old and “new”. That’s really informed my idea of resilience and problematized the term for me. I think of it as something that’s old and passed down, and continues to come into being, but is always fluid. 
    *CT:  It’s interesting to think through how these very intangible things are always forced to work through capitalism, and how it often ends up creating more barriers for the people it’s supposed to be helping. What has been your biggest concern in 2020? 
    *E: The one that keeps me up at night is that 2020 has been shaped by all these huge tumultuous events and happenings that are shaking a lot of people, and has made the most vulnerable even further disenfranchised. My fear is that this is the beginning of an ongoing reality without a break. Earlier in the year, people were really worn down by land defence work. This was quickly followed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to continue to call for abolition and justice. And now, there’s the huge climate catastrophe. My fear is that this is only the beginning of a continual, rolling crisis. Most of my fears in the past that come to mind have been personal fears, but this is a collective fear. If it’s inescapable, then that’s terrifying to me.
    *CT:  How have you been working through these fears and anxieties?
    *E: I’m fortunate and privileged to have homes that I can go to. I find that with the need to limit the number of people I see on a daily basis, I’ve become much more intentional about the quality and intensity of my relationships and developing explicit modes of care. Just having things to do is important. I started my position with Massy Books the week that the province shut down, and having income and being involved in the outside world instead of just sinking into my own head has been a necessity. Being able to see that things can still happen in some small ways has been important. My mom also got a puppy before COVID-19, and I’ve been very present with his upbringing. I honestly think he’s gotten everybody through this time. I also spend time outside with the water and with the land, which has been necessary. 
    *CT:  Can you tell us a bit more about Massy Books and your role with Massy?
    *E: Massy Books is an Indigenous-owned bookstore that’s been in Chinatown for about three years. Our founding principles are centred around community activity and community care, and we hope to facilitate new collaborations and new connections in creative communities and in the world. Prior to COVID-19, we would have readings multiple times a week and host other events. There’s also an art gallery upstairs, and we formalized an arts society last year. There’s Massy Books, which is the for-profit bookstore, but there’s also Massy Arts Society, where I’m the first official staff member. Currently we’re doing online programs, and I’m hoping to branch out into off-site public art, and have more visual arts collaborations. With the Massy Arts Society, I curate the exhibitions outdoors, and I’m implementing an administrative skeleton to a new arts society. I’m also looking for ways to further expand our creative practices. I’m also the media manager for the bookstore. 
    *CT:  What are your considerations for what and who to include in the art space, and what is the goal of the art society?
    *E: I think I try to take a holistic approach that takes into consideration Massy Arts Society’s role. It’s a beautiful space, but because it is a smaller gallery, it allows more flexibility. It’s a space that allows artists to have more agency over what they do. I approach curating in a way such that Massy Arts Society is committed to artists who might otherwise face more barriers in accessing gallery spaces, and who are otherwise underrepresented. The professional art gallery world is so highly exclusive. In our space, I prioritize artists who might not be formally educated, who are emerging, who might be racialized, Indigenous, or have alternative practices. I think the exciting part of curating is thinking about connections across practices and mediums where connections are not assumed to be. I also think that, as someone who is privileged to be educated and to have figured out routes in the visual arts that other people don’t have access to, it’s my responsibility to share the resources that I have. Now that I have the knowledge that has allowed me to make a living for myself, it’s my responsibility to advocate for systems that better support artists.
    *CT:  Even though it’s called Chinatown, the space has always been the site where marginalized groups lived. Chinatown was a pocket where Indigenous folks and a lot of people of colour were able to build community. As someone who’s working in an Indigenous space, what does it mean to you to be in Chinatown?
    *E: Chinatown is a space created because of exclusion elsewhere. It had historically been where a lot of people can find solace, but now it’s being threatened by gentrification. The limitation on Indigenous and racialized people to make a home or community is an ever present threat. In working in Chinatown, and in spending time and money in the community, I’m trying to ensure there’s still space for people, and trying to be respectful. As an Indigenous person, I think about how we can build kinship and relationship with the people whose land we’re on, and there are multiple layers in Chinatown. It’s unceded Indigenous territory, and yet there’s another community that also has an important relationship to the space. As someone who’s not of the host nation, and who doesn’t belong to the Chinese community, I think about how I can be respectful while being in that space. It’s a continual reminder to push back against imperial and colonial projects. I think the recent damage to the space through gentrification and the literal loss of life in the Downtown Eastside community is just a reminder that colonialism has shifted into different forms. We need to take a complex assertion of sovereignty and our rights to live, and to live happily. I predominantly work from home, and I go to Massy about one day a week. I don’t have a day-to-day relationship that the folks who live there and who live there would have. I have the privilege of choosing when I go and when I leave, and I’m not personally impacted by the challenges the people who live there would have to face. 
    *CT:  There is an idea in urban planning that argues that beautification of a neighbourhood signals that white bodies are moving into the space. In a lot of instances, this drives up real estate prices, and pushes marginalized groups from their own communities. What are your thoughts on art and gentrification?
    *E: I feel that art’s role in displacement is really problematic, and I’m still working through it. I got into art because of a personal need to create and to learn about colonialism through artistic practices, but while I don’t think the artistic practices themselves are problematic, artistic organizations and pursuits often inherit colonialism. On one hand, I think the non-profit world has horrible structures in place, but on the other hand, I came into my personhood through these structures, and learning alongside and from other artists has rounded my perspective and understanding of what colonialism is and does. I think art is often utilized as a way to beautify a very violent machine, such that horrible companies can attempt to justify their existence through tokenizing creative practices or pursuits. I’m becoming more comfortable in speaking out against the utilization of artistic practices in dangerous ways. At Massy’s art gallery, we strive to shape the space for the community, and not just for us, or folks who have the means. We’re working on the strong community connections that we have, so that our work is rooted in community and for the community.
    *CT:  You mentioned you came into art as a personal practice. Are there ways in which your art manifests as a form of resilience or resurgence? How do those aspects come out in your art?
    *E: I got into visual arts predominantly because I loved ceramics. It wasn’t very much a conceptual pursuit. At the same time, I was studying philosophy, which in any given syllabus is full of staunchy old white dudes. A lot of my practice thinks about what it means to know and to carry stories within your body. I’m descended from white Europeans who enacted the violence of colonialism, as well as folks that lost a lot of their rights because they were Indigenous. Colonialism is a consuming machine. It wants to either destroy your knowledge or your right to a good life, or consume it in its own mechanics. I view deliberate confusion as resilience. For a few years now, I’ve been exploring how artists can communicate with one another, build kinships, and learn from one another, while being deliberately misunderstood or misrecognized so as to avoid being either consumed or destroyed in the process. I recognize it’s a complex practice I need to tread on lightly.
    *CT:  Do you think art and culture are interchangeable in the context of colonial consumption?
    *E: I think art as culture sounds like art is too high on itself. I think culture is so much bigger than that, and art is one aspect of culture. Even defining what art is can be problematic, because it’s often done in a way where whiteness points to things and dictates whether something is art. But there are other concepts for what art might be. I think culture is a set of changing practices, and it is much more expansive than what I might consider art, or what our grant culture might determine to be art. I think I value when it’s fluid and changing.
    *CT:  In what ways have the challenges of 2020 come out in your work? 
    *E: I haven’t been so involved in my personal practice because of capacity more than anything else. I want to give my personal practice the space to come and go, rather than have that pressure of having to perform or to create. I typically lived in Vancouver, but because of COVID-19, I ended up spending two months at my parents’. I do a lot of floral beadwork, but all of my art supplies were in Vancouver. I noticed that the toilet paper had a perfect flower pattern on it, so I ended up beading through different materials than I had on hand. Lately, I’ve been working with an Australian artist, Marlena Reed. She’s an artist who typically researches traditional fishing techniques and ecology, and her art practice is closely tied to local species as well as the water. There are webcams setup around beaches which follow seals, so she’s thinking through how we related to these species through imperialism, and now through the result of the climate catastrophe, and our encroachment on these species and its repercussions. COVID-19 has asked me to collaborate with people who are further away and to think through our relationship to other species a lot more in my art practice. Previously I’ve been thinking through how to relate to my ancestors through these lands I’ve never been to, and now I’m doing a 2020 version of that. 
    *CT:  2020 has been an opportunity to create space for social change, and some of the larger conversations have been around Black Lives Matter and what’s happening locally in the Downtown Eastside because of the opioid overdose crisis and homelessness. Because Massy is on the peripheries of where Hogan’s Alley used to be and close to the Downtown Eastside, what does it mean to occupy this space at this particular time?
    *E: There’s undeniable activity around Hogan’s Alley earlier this year, and it was very present in our day to day. It was also a necessary call to action for Massy as well, to leverage resources to help reclaim that space and to bring visibility to the histories as well as the present communities that are shaped by what happened at Hogan’s Alley. There needs to be safety resources made available for those folks in the Downtown Eastside for the pandemic. At Massy, we have a lot of conversations around racial justice and how to put an end to anti-Black violence in Indigenous organizing circles. There’s a lot of anti-Black and anti-Asian racism in Indigenous communities, and it’s important to recognize that even though Indigneous folks have faced a lot of violence and discrimination from the state, we’ve also enacted various forms of violence. We’ve had a lot of conversations about what is long, slow work, and what is quick work that we can do now. We’re taking our best guesses at what the best course of action is, and we’re bound to mess up, but I hope that we’re putting things in place so that we’re more accountable to different communities. 
    *CT:  Can you tell us more about the short and longer term goals at Massy and how you’re working through them?
    *E: One thing I really value about working at Massy is that Patricia is particularly responsive and open to suggestions or incorporating new information as they surface. As soon as COVID-19 happened, she was aware of various services that exist for people who experience different realities such as gendered violence to cope with COVID-19, and we strategized on how to get this information out to folks who might benefit from it. I think making these quick changes is how you achieve your long-term goal. A lot of the other spaces I’ve worked in didn’t have long-term goals that were as clear as they could be, and I think that when your long-term goals aren’t clear, like figuring out what it means to be in good relations with host nations, you end up stalling on things like how to do a land acknowledgement. But your relationship with the host nation changes all the time, and it’s really a question about how to build relationships in the day-to-day. Patricia has a very clear long-term goal that’s more about how Massy fits into the larger narrative from this particular part of the world.
    *CT:  Are there other ways in which Massy has had to change its practices because of COVID-19?
    *E: We’ve gone through a number of changes to cope with the realities of COVID-19. For safety reasons, we closed our storefront in mid-March. We started doing deliveries and hired local people who had recently lost their jobs as delivery drivers. We started offering reduced shipping rates, and since then, our online sales have remained really high. There are a lot of folks who are supporting us throughout this time. We recognize that we’re not the only bookstore that had to radically change everything overnight, so we partnered with some other bookstores on a few initiatives. For example, MacLeod’s Books doesn’t have an online system, so we assisted with their deliveries for a while. In June, when a lot of people were waking up to racial inequities, violence, as well as Black resilience and brilliance, our online orders skyrocketed around the protests surrounding George Floyd’s murder. It’s heartening to know that these titles which discuss tumultuous histories that we always prioritize bringing in are finally in the spotlight. It’s nice to know that people are doing the work. In my job with Massy Arts Society, this move away from physical spaces has really pushed us to think about accessibility in the arts, and we’ve seen more conversations about it in the last few years. COVID-19 has really pushed us to do the work that we’ve been thinking of doing, and to consider what it means to access visual art spaces in a number of ways.
    *CT:  It’s been a challenge having to rethink our day-to-day practices, but it is also really cool to see how creative people can be with their artistic practices. Has there been an activity, recipe, or practice that has helped you get through these times?
    *E: Walking the dog has been the biggest joy. I feel like we’ve been in COVID-19 for so long now that these things just seem like my routine, and it’s hard to think about what I wasn’t doing before. I’ve been having lots more phone calls, still trying to find time to go outside to remind myself that I have a physical body. I’ve been trying to spend time with bodies of water. That’s what’s been helping me get through. Speaking of how COVID-19 has changed things, I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the people who have reached out to Massy, or to the writers and artists we’ve partnered with who have been so open to venture down routes with us. It’s been a joy, because there have been lots of folks who have made wonderful things happen in situations that they didn't’ choose to confront, not being able to gather, for example. There’s been a lot of willingness to be explorative and experimental from the artists and writers we’ve partnered with, and I really value that. Our role has always been to create and hold space, and anything we’ve been able to do has been because of folks who have reached out or who have agreed to work with us.

    blurb: `Alain Chow has always dreamed of being a restaurateur. He moved to Vancouver in 2011, and has been the sous chef at Bao Bei Chinese Brasserie for the past eight years. Located at 163 Keefer Street, Bao Bei woos its patrons with a casual and intimate dining experience using flavours borrowed from Chinese diasporas across the globe. Since the pandemic, Bao Bei has served as the staging area for Chinatown Care Packages, which is a weekly grocery program that delivers culturally appropriate produce and optional cooked meals to Chinese seniors. Alain chats with Chinatown Today about how the pandemic has affected the operation of restaurants, and what 吃苦 (eating bitter) has taught him about resilience.`,
    title: `Alain Chow`,
    subtitle: `Bao Bei Chinese Brasserie`,
    content: `*CT: What do you think of when you think of Chinatown?
    *A: So many things come to mind. From the Jack Nicholson movie to just the idea of space for Chinese people. I think about growing up in the various Chinatowns in Toronto, places where we used to get Chinese baked goods and groceries. Even from a very young age, there was a sense of belonging, but exoticism as well.
    *CT: Do you notice many parallels between Chinatowns in different cities? 
    *A: Of course. In larger cities like Toronto, New York, and San Francisco, there are similarities in colour scheme and types of shops. The apothecaries come to mind very quickly, as do the barbeque and baked goods shops. It’s a lot of the Cantonese and Hakka diaspora in North America. My interaction with Chinatown in Toronto was different. The main difference is proximity to DTES of the Vancouver Chinatown versus the Chinatowns in Toronto. It’s a more challenging place to live, to experience, and to be around. That is a main difference that always colours my perception of Chinatown.
    *CT:  Why is Vancouver’s Chinatown important to you? 
    *A: Chinatown is home to me in its own sense. I’ve spent the last nine years here, almost everyday. I’m now part business owner, I work here everyday, and I support businesses here. It’s a place of refuge for my culture, because it’s a repository for our food, our language, and our ethnicity. It’s a place of belonging.
    *CT: What’s your fondest memory in Chinatown?
    *A: My fondest memory would be the opening of Kissa Tanto. I’ve been working in restaurants for almost 20 years now, and it’s always been a dream of mine to be a restauranteur. When the opportunity presented itself, it was a lifelong dream come true. Everything in that first year of when Kissa Tanto first opened was a happy memory for me.
    *CT: What does resilience mean to you?
    *A: It means putting in continuous effort in the face of adversity. Chinatowns around the world are all examples of resilience, especially this year. The fact that we’re all still here, not throwing in the towel and moving to another neighbourhood, means we believe in this neighbourhood, and believe in the people of this neighbourhood. I think that's a good example of resilience. It’s been a difficult year for everyone, but working and being involved in this neighbourhood makes it feel like there’s been more adversity here than in others. Resilience is not necessarily being rough, or macho, or strong, and it doesn’t mean being unbreakable. It’s being able to do something even when it’s not easy. 
    *CT: Marginalized communities, especially in the DTES, tend to fall through the cracks, especially in these hard times. Since you work in the neighbourhood, what are some of the ways you’ve seen or experienced the COVID-19 pandemic?
    *A: We shut down the restaurants before the mandate. We felt something larger was coming, and we wanted to ensure the safety of our customers and our staff. Since reopening, we’ve had to build barriers and take tables out. We’ve had to adapt to higher cleaning standards, new parameters on how staff interact with customers, how we receive orders from suppliers, and skyrocketing produce prices. The activity of the neighbourhood denizens has gone down. Chinese people have been coming less, and there has been an increase of homeless folks.
    *CT: Can you say more about the increase in product prices? Do you get your products locally or do they come from abroad?
    *A: In the summer we buy mostly local. We work with six different farms throughout the lower mainland to buy the freshest vegetables we can. Our suppliers know we prioritize local vegetables over those from California or Mexico during the times when it’s available. But with COVID-19 this summer, these local farms were simply not planting and not operating to their fullest extent, if at all. The local abundance we normally have was just not there, and the local vegetables we can get have a much steeper price. The vegetables imported from California and Mexico have been much more expensive as well. There are also COVID-related supply chain issues, such as products not coming across the border as quickly as possible, or wholesalers just having a low inventory of stuff. 
    *CT: What do you think are the ways this pandemic will change Chinatown? 
    *A: I’m part of the Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, which is a team that’s been assembled by the City through the Chinatown Transformation Team to try and have a say in what Chinatown’s future will look like. It was already a difficult task before the pandemic. Now it has become even more difficult to organize virtually. We have funding from the City that we’ve divided into four working groups, and each group is trying to work on an initiative that will support Chinatown’s future. I feel that Chinatown is worth saving and is worth being a part of, but I don’t know what it will look like a couple of years from now, or even in six months. We constantly talk about how to revitalize Chinatown, and we have lots of ideas that we’re slowly working on to try and realize. COVID-19 has been what we hope to be a speedbump, but at the moment, it feels like the wall from Game of Thrones. 
    *CT: What are some examples of cultural assets or intangible heritage you see in your day to day life?
    *A: People come to Chinatown for both tangible and intangible things. They come to eat, do their shopping, to preserve their language, to practice martial arts, and to learn new things. This feeling of belonging, of community, is intangible. It’s not bought, it’s not quantified, but that sense of belonging in a community is felt. Seeing people of the same background and doing the same things that you’re doing, that is an intangible positive. 
    *CT: In Chinatown, there are businesses that have been here for generations, as well as relatively newer businesses like Bao Bei. What does it mean to be a newer business in Chinatown, and where do you see yourself fitting in the community? 
    *A: There’s a definite incumbent versus newcomer bias, as with anything in Chinatown. Chinatown has to evolve, and I personally want a say in how it evolves. Perhaps some of the older businesses don’t see that, or are resistant to that, but it’s not about us versus them. It should be a cooperative effort. Bao Bei has been here for 10 years now, and we are part of the community. I think COVID-19 has shown us that we can always be bigger parts of the community, which is what we’ve pushed more for. I hope and want Kissa Tanto to be more involved in the community as well. It’s taken some time to build before we started remobilizing revenues towards different things, but now we are in the position where we can take care of our employees better, and we can be more active in the community. We’re looking forward to being able to do that.
    *CT: Bao Bei does a lot of things behind the scenes that a lot of people don’t know about, one of them being the Chinatown Care packages. Can you tell us a bit about what that is?
    *A: Chinatown Care Packages is an initiative started by Chinatown Today, Yarrow Intergenerational Society for Justice, and the hua foundation. In the first couple of days after lock down, the folks at hua foundation reached out to me about helping out the seniors in the community. I jumped on board because food security is important to me. I volunteer for the Greater Vancouver Food Bank, and Bao Bei supports the Chinatown Seniors Community Kitchen. Logistically there was a bunch of food at the restaurants that needed to be repurposed. The program ended up being a way of getting culturally appropriate groceries out to the seniors, plus some cooked food for those that wanted it. With my contacts with local suppliers, we could order the products from the grocery stores in Chinatown, I could cook in the kitchen, and we could use the floor space to package and distribute groceries. Bao Bei was a natural fit to be the staging area.
    *CT: Are there things you’ve learned or have been surprised about through this experience of participating in Chinatown Care Packages?
    *A: So much. I had not been part of a grassroots, community initiative before, and I learned a lot about funding, how much support an initiative like this can receive, and how it all happens. We raised quite a sum of money in a ridiculously short period of time during a time when I thought people would be tightening their purse strings. I’m constantly impressed by how quickly and cohesively the community can come together to get behind a project. It was also new to me to organize in this context. I met and am working with some wonderful people, and I got to know people who I’ve worked with before in a different context. 
    *CT: Just having a sense of community has been so important, because COVID-19 can be so isolating. Did you have any big fears or worries during these times? How have they affected your mental health?
    *A: I definitely had some existential angst about whether this is the end of civilization as we know it. It was an exhausting March and April, being in lockdown while still trying to make sense of it all, and to take care of my family, my staff, and the restaurants. I threw myself into work, because work is what made sense, and it was at least a constant I could look forward to. Mental health was definitely a big challenge. I came down into Chinatown during lockdown everyday, and I was worried about the community here, transmission rates, as well as vandalism. But going back to the word resilience, I recently came across a zine called Eat Bitter, which is 吃苦 in Chinese. It’s something I’ve heard throughout my life, and definitely felt like I was eating a lot of bitter March through May. I think resilience is in our genetic make up. I ate a lot of bitter, and I try really hard not to regurgitate it. Sometimes I can’t help it.
    *CT: Speaking of people pulling together and organizing, have you seen much of the Black Lives Matter movement? 
    *A: How it unfolded, and how quickly it unfolded took a lot of people by surprise. I cheered it on. I’ve been a keen observer of police brutality, especially against Black people. There are a lot more Black people in Toronto where I grew up compared to here in Vancouver. I didn’t see or understand how BLM would translate in Vancouver. I had to educate myself. I didn’t know what Hogan’s Alley was, even though it was literally next door. They were our neighbours. We had planned to collect a portion of Bao Bei’s food sales during weekly Sunday dinners for Chinatown Care Packages, but we ended up redirecting funds to Hogan’s Alley Society and Black Lives Matter Vancouver. I saw the blockade on the Georgia Viaduct as part of the BLM movement in support of Hogan’s Alley. Seeing one of our staff at Bao Bei experience this, and talking to her about this, was an emotional thing for me as well. We continue to support Hogan’s Alley and Black Lives Matter Vancouver, and there’s a part of me that’s glad that there’s this upheaval in the US and around the world, because it’s a chance to finally rip off the band-aids so those wounds heal better than before. People need to see this movement, hear about it, talk about it, and respond to it. Things need to change.
    *CT: Do you have any observations on policing in Chinatown? 
    *A: The Vancouver Police Department (VPD)’s policing is laughable to me. I understand that I don’t see everything from their point of view, but anecdotally, experientially, there’s really nothing the VPD can do when a crime occurs. VPD is in the neighbourhood. If uniforms were on the beat more often, would there be fewer low-level petty crimes? There might be. I don’t know. But their presence is not felt, or experienced other than when something bad has happened, or they’re all congregating at the Dalina and having coffee. I understand their jobs are difficult and they’re human beings as well, but maybe my idea of policing and the VPD is different from what it should be. I feel that the VPD are kind of powerless in Vancouver, and especially Chinatown.
    *CT: What are some ways you think the general population can support the community?
    *A: Chinatown’s continual survival and prosperity depends on the community coming here to make it happen. There needs to be people here shopping, eating at the restaurants, walking the streets, conversing, and sharing. Their presence would mitigate some of the friction between the communities. When there’s more people on the streets, there’s less people spray painting the walls. When there are more people at the restaurants, there are less people being accosted. If there are more people around, then everything is better.
    *CT: What have you been doing or making during the pandemic to take care of yourself? 
    *A: I’ve been spending time with my partner and her family. She is Chinese-Venezualan, and with the recent upheaval in Venezuela, her entire family has moved here and live under one roof. I spend a lot of time with them now, which gives me happiness. They’re a hospitality family as well. They own Chinese restaurants in Venezuela, so everything is centered around food. That’s totally in my wheelhouse. We eat a lot, everybody takes turns cooking, we all sit around a giant round table with a spinning centre, just like at Chinese restaurants. It’s good to spend time with them and decompress.

    blurb: `Mrs. Kuang has been a part of the Chinatown neighbourhood for almost a quarter of a century. As a member of the Chinatown Concern Group, Mrs. Kuang has been adamant about speaking out against the gentrification of Chinatown. In 2017, her fiery speech at City Hall in opposition to the 105 Keefer project earned her the hearts of Chinatown youths and community organizers alike. Mrs. Kuang tells Chinatown Today about the immediate needs of the Chinese senior communities in Chinatown, why Chinese folks should support Indigenous peoples in so-called Canada, and what she loves about hanging out about diasporic Chinese youths. If you want to read about some wholesome intergenerational bonding, this is an interview you don’t want to miss. Additionally, if you speak Cantonese or Mandarin and want to spend some quality time making dumplings, playing mahjong, and singing karaoke with cool Chinese seniors like Mrs. Kuang, get in touch with the Yarrow Intergeneration Society.

    content: `*CT: 您在唐人街住多久了？
    *CT: How long have you lived in Chinatown? 
    
    *K: 二十幾多年了。我1994年來的，到加拿大兩三年就來唐人街住了。我是廣東湛江人。
    *K: More than twenty years。 I came to Canada in 1994, and moved to Chinatown two or three years after. I’m from Zhanjiang in Guangdong
    
    *CT: 您跟家人来的吗？
    *CT: Did you come here with family?
    
    *K: 我通过女兒申請來。我和老公來了十幾天她就回香港了。我們兩公婆在這裏做洗碗工，做家庭清潔。那時候可以做，什麼工作都做過。在大陸的時候做過很多生意。
    *K: My daughter applied for me to come. My daughter went back to Hong Kong a few days after my husband and I came here. The two of us made a living working as dishwashers, house cleaners. I was able to work then, and we worked lots of different jobs. We ran different businesses in China before coming here.
    
    *CT: 您為什麼選擇來加拿大？
    *CT: Why did you choose to come to Canada?
    
    *K: 我喜歡加拿大，因為我女兒在这里。这里民主。大陸政策運動多，不知道會怎麼样。我有五個子女。我常擔心他們，擔心學校造反，作為父母害怕。在这里，我夠膽上市政廳提意見了，所有地方都重視老人有沒有來，在大陸才不會。而且我喜歡這裡氣候。我一來就沒有回頭，咬著牙根挨下去。撐十年就有養老金。我常常报税，现在扣钱，沒什麼錢剩下來了，都女兒照顧。
    *K: I love Canada because my daughter was here. It’s democratic here. There was a lot of political shift in China, you never know what’s going to happen. I have five children, and I was always worried about them, worried about their schools. As a parent I was scared. Here, I can make my opinions heard at city hall, and at the meetings they care about seniors. That wouldn’t happen in China. I also like the climate here. I haven’t looked back since coming here. I grit my teeth and bear what comes my way. After ten years here, I earned my old age security. I have been paying taxes, so there’s not much left. My daughter takes care of it.
    
    *CT: 您在唐人街最早或最喜歡的記憶是什麼？
    *CT: What is your earliest or fondest memory?
    
    *K: 最喜歡就以前的旺盛，很熱鬧，有很多間買菜的，那時候有華埠超級市場。所以按我看法，政府沒有理由不理唐人街，因為是唐人的中心，他不會收的，唐人街應該會發展的，只是因為現在疫症關係無法搞，唐人街收檔就沒成唐人街了。
    *K: I liked the vibrancy from before. Chinatown was flourishing, there were a lot of places to get groceries. And there was the Chinatown Supermarket. I say that the government has no reason to neglect Chinatown, because Chinatown is a centre for Chinese people. It can’t fall. Chinatown should continue to be developed, but it’s so hard with the pandemic. Chinatown won’t be Chinatown anymore if things keep closing.
    
    *CT: 在您居住在唐人街這段時間以來，您有發現什麼改變嗎？
    *CT: Since you’ve come to live in the Chinatown community, how have you seen it change?
    
    *K: 我們初來的時候很熱鬧。現在差得遠了。
    *K: When we first came, the neighbourhood was very vibrant and lively. It’s very different now. 
    
    *CT: 您是否希望唐人街恢復舊時候那樣？我有留意到現在不少年輕的唐人有在唐人街開一些店。雖然不像以前的那些店，可是還是唐人開的，你有什麼看法？
    *CT: Do you wish that Chinatown was back to the way it was before? I see a lot of younger Chinese people opening shops. They’re not like the shops as before, but they’re still Chinese owned and operated. What do you think about this?
    
    *K: 當然希望是同聲同氣的，現在有的一條雪糕都要五六元，誰會吃？現在餐館少。老人家要一盅兩件，貴的怎樣吃得下，退休金哪裡會夠吃呢？ 需要適應唐人。我當然希望興旺的，廉價的，讓退休的能享受到。我們吃的一盅兩件，有時候一個飯吃兩餐的。像排骨飯，雞粒飯，老人家吃不到很多，他拿一盅飯，吃不完會拿回去中午吃。需要為老人打算。
    *K: Of course I hope they’re like-minded people. There is a place now that sells ice cream for $5 or $6. Who can afford that? There are fewer restaurants now. Seniors just need a cup of tea and a couple side dishes. How can we afford the expensive restaurants with just our old age security? Places in Chinatown need to be suited to Chinese people. Of course I hope Chinatown can be vibrant and economical, so even those who are retired can have the means to enjoy living here. Sometimes we split a meal into two. Seniors don’t eat very much. With dishes like pork ribs with rice or chicken rice, we will take it home and eat it for lunch when we can’t finish it. These new shops need to think about the seniors. 
    
    
    *CT: 您聽到唐人街這個詞會想到什麼？
    *CT: What do you think of when you hear the term Chinatown?
    
    *K: 唐人街是唐人最重要的中心。紀念碑都在那裡，加上是個旅遊點，哪裡來都會來唐人街參觀的。將來興旺是我心想的，但是我的看法就是肯定會倒塌。我看這形勢，政府都沒有什麼重視。
    *K: Chinatown is the most important centre for Chinese people. The memorials are there, plus it’s a tourist attraction, and people come from all over to visit. I want Chinatown to thrive in the future, but in my view, it will collapse. The government hasn’t paid it attention.
    
    *CT: 是因為疫情還是其他問題？
    *CT: Is it because of the pandemic or other issues?
    
    *K: 是因為疫情一回事，更沒可說，我都沒有出外。加拿大政府好的地方就是很照顧我們老人。但是大局來講，唐人街長時間都搞不好，疫情時間沒有重視。附近只有一個超市，很多地方都收了。現在情況越來越差。我希望三級政府重視，搞好唐人街。我初時很大的信心唐人街不會倒，但現在看這個形勢都很危機。
    *K: The pandemic is one thing, that’s for sure, I haven’t even gone outside. The good thing about the government is that they treat seniors very well. But broadly speaking, Chinatown is a long term project and it hasn’t gotten proper attention during the pandemic. There’s only one greengrocer left in Chinatown, and a lot of places are closed. The situation is deteriorating. I hope three levels of government would pay attention to what’s happening in Chinatown. I used to be confident that Chinatown will survive, but we are in a crisis. 
    
    *CT: 我同意您講的。全部政府都要出手幫助，特別是老人家
    *CT: I agree with you. All levels of government need to help, especially with seniors
    
    *K: 對，因為個人做不到什麼，一定要集中在這裡的社團。因為我喜歡唱歌跳舞，我以前到處都去。現在什麼都沒有。疫情難講，不知道搞到什麼時候。不過說起今次疫情來講，我对這裡的社團很滿足。有社工幫我們買菜，送菜送到門口，十元一個星期買來自己付錢的菜，沒有買肉。有的是政府付。什麼都要政府資助。最重要是重視和發動群眾。
    *K: Yes, because we can’t do much individually. We need to rally the community organizations. I like to sing and dance, and I used to be very social. There’s nothing now. The pandemic is difficult to predict, and we don’t know how long it will last. But because of the pandemic, I’ve been very satisfied with the community organizations. We have a volunteer who helps us buy fresh vegetables and deliver them to our doors, only $10 a week which we paid for ourselves. Some are subsidized by the government. We need funding from the government. The most important thing is for the government to pay attention and to mobilize the general population. 
    
    *CT: 我希望未來這幾年會有變化，希望年青人回來振興，做的會有幫助。
    *CT: I hope there will be changes these few years, and that young people will come back to revitalize Chinatown to be helpful to the community. 
    
    *K: 是啊，現在也很多義工，青年男女，都做很多工作。但要出錢才可以。
    *K: Yes, currently there are a lot of youth volunteers who are doing a lot. But there needs to be funding.
    
    *CT: 您認為新冠肺炎對唐人街的未來會有什麼影響？
    *CT: How do you think the pandemic will impact the future of Chinatown?
    
    *K: 大影響。沒得出門口，老人家又病多，政府又消耗，醫藥費多。我們真的聽話門口沒有出，我們這棟樓都是老人家很少出去。不過有一個星期送一次青菜來，特別我們有病的送到房門。以前我們出去又打太極，又打劍，又跳舞，起碼有活動。最緊要，提意見組織多找年輕人幫帶老人家看病。唐人街應該政府要重視才可以。三級政府要願意調動金錢才可以。
    *K: It’ll have a huge impact. No one can go out, and us seniors are prone to illness. The government has a lot of expenditure on medical expenses. The seniors in our building take the regulations very seriously, and we don’t go out. We just have groceries delivered to our door once a week, especially for those that are ill. We used to go out for Tai Chi, sword exercise, dance. At least we got to move. The most important thing is I suggest for the organizations to find more young people to accompany seniors to see doctors. Chinatown needs attention and from all levels of government. There needs to be funding.
    
    *CT: 您覺得現在唐人街最需要什麼？
    *CT: What do you think Chinatown needs the most right now?
    
    *K: 最緊要買菜。我們有病，去大統華都辛苦。那天我去日升，推車仔去，在Hastings 跌了一跤。幸好沒有斷骨，暈了一下，後腦破了一個洞。在醫院时我心跳太慢，心臟開了刀放起搏器進去，現在也還沒有痊癒。跟你講話沒問題，很精神，但是走出去丟垃圾都很辛苦，走路道氣頂上來很辛苦。
    *K: Grocery stores. We are ill, even going to T&T is a huge challenge. The other day I was on my way to Sunrise Market with my shopping cart, and I fell at Hastings St. Luckily I didn’t break any bones, but I fainted, and hit the back of my head. When I was at the hospital, my heart rate was too low. They had to operate on my heart and put in a pacemaker. I haven’t fully recovered yet. I can still carry on this conversation with no problem, but it’s hard to walk around, even to take out the garbage. I have difficulty breathing.
    
    *CT: 您對’無形文化遺產‘這個詞是什麼看法？不一定是建築或物件，但您覺得什麼算是遺產？有些人認為人的關係，吃的，都是文化遺產，雖然城市講大建築多。您覺得呢？
    *CT: What are your thoughts around intangible heritage? It doesn’t have to be buildings or things, but what do you consider to be heritage? Some people think heritage is also people’s relationships and the foods they eat, even though the city mainly talks about historical buildings.  What do you think?
    
    *K: 當然了，文化和歷史，像紀念的地方，像文化中心，孫中山公園，那些都應該繼續發展下去等多一點人去觀看中國的文化歷史。
    *K: Of course, the culture and history, like memorials, like the Chinese Cultural Centre, and Dr. Sun Yat Sen Garden, those should continue to be developed so that more people can go visit and see Chinese culture and history.
    
    *CT: 你覺得政府可以如何幫我們學這些？
    *CT: How do you think the government can help us learn about these?
    
    *K: 開班吧，我們老人家不知道很多的，又不在這裡出生。多一點班，找年輕人來教，來學。可以這樣學習文化。現在有很多大學生，叫他們做義工，開班。最好搞一些英文課，中文課。很多老人家不會英文，又不記得中文是真的。但是現在疫情都沒有人能出去。
    *K: They should start some classes, because there’s plenty us seniors don’t know, because we weren’t born here. More classes, find young people to teach and take classes. You can learn about culture this way. There are a lot of university students, get them to volunteer, and start classes. It would be best to have some English and Chinese lessons, too. Lots of seniors can’t speak English, and the trouble is real when we can’t remember Chinese either.
    But because of the pandemic now, no one can go out.
    
    *CT: 最近有很多遊行抗議。您有聽說嗎？
    *CT: There have been a lot of protests lately. Have you heard anything?
    
    *K: 是不是土住民？我們就應該幫他們的，有什麼都幫。
    *K: Is it about Indigenous people? We should help and support them however we can.
    
    *CT: 你覺得為什麼要幫助？
    *CT: Why do you think we should support them?
    
    *K: 因為土地是他們的。不公平的。我們應該幫助他們的，我們參加很多抗議的。我們同情他們，關注組有參加抗議的。
    *K: Because the land is theirs. It is unfair. We should support them and participate in more protests. We empathize with them. The Concern Group participated in lots of protests.
    
    *CT: 你覺得其他老人家也是一樣想的？
    *CT: Do you think other seniors think this way, too?
    
    *K: 是，關注組很多人都參加抗議的。同情因為土地是屬於原住民的。我們支持。
    *K: Yes. A lot of people from the concern group participate in the protests. We sympathize with them, because the land belongs to the Indigenous people. We support them.
    
    *CT: 你有沒有想這個疫情還會多久？
    *CT: Have you thought about how long the pandemic will last?
    
    *K: 我沒有想，但是聽說會到明年。聽華僑之聲常說會到明年。我以前踩單車的，住列治文的時候，兩公婆在富大洗碗，騎單車到Granville街尾要兩個小時。我以前常踩的，有了孫我女兒就不讓我踩。我今年八十八歲了。
    *K: I didn’t think about it, but I hear it will last until next year. The radio said it will be next year. I used to bike everywhere when I used to live in Richmond. My husband and I washed dishes at Floata, so we would bike to the end of Granville. It takes two hours. I used to ride a lot, but since my daughter had my grandon, she didn’t want me to bike anymore. I am 88 years old this year. 
    
    *CT: 你一天內會做什麼？
    *CT: What do you do in a day?
    
    *K: 有什麼做！又不敢出門口，就在家打兩下太極拳，看戲，聽新聞。有時候走走，站站，這樣繼續下去真會骨軟。好悶，有些老人家有打電話聊天，沒有到訪。如果繼續下去真的骨都軟了。我有電視，朋友給我影帶，影碟，我沒事做就看戲。我喜歡看戲，喜歡唱卡拉OK，但是擔心吵到別人，疫情沒有唱。我以前會和年輕人一起，做水餃吃，唱歌，但是疫情所以沒有了。
    
    *K: What is there to do? I am afraid of going out, so I just do some Tai Chi at home, watch some TV, listen to the news. Sometimes I walk around or stand for a bit, or else my body will become weak. I feel studdy and bored, some seniors would phone and we chat for a bit, but no visits. If this goes on my bones will get soft. I have a TV. Friends gave me tapes and DVDs, and I watch them when I have nothing to do. I like to watch movies and shows and sing karaoke, but I’m worried about being too loud and bothering others so I don’t sing during the pandemic. I used to spend time with young people, we would make dumplings and sing karaoke, but not during the pandemic.
    
    *CT: 和年輕人在一起開心嗎？
    *CT: Does it make you happy to spend time with young people?
    
    *K: 很有意義的。
    *K: It’s very meaningful.
    
    *CT: 為什麼有意義？
    *CT: Why is it meaningful?
    
    *K: 後生一輩什麼都新鮮，我們老鬼。開心。我到處都去的，和活躍。像他們在紀念碑打麻將我也有去，打麻將唱卡拉OK。我喜歡和他們在一起，他們也喜歡和我在一起。
    *K: Everything is new and refreshing with the younger generation, and we are old. It’s fun. I used to be very social and go everywhere. I’d go when they had mahjong and karaoke at the memorial square. I like being with them, and they like to be with me, too.
    
    *CT: 你希望他們在老人家身上學到什麼？
    *CT: What do you hope they can learn from seniors?
    
    *K: 學中國文化，唱歌，跳喔，我喜歡跳舞。他們打麻將每次都去捧場。
    *K: I hope they learn about Chinese culture, and sing and dance. I like to dance. I go watch them play mahjong every time.
    
    *CT: 你有沒有在年輕人身上學到什麼？
    *CT: Have you learned anything new from the youth?
    
    *K: 有，很多。他們活躍，跟他們在一起很開心，好講好笑。每年我生日請兩圍都是關注組的。我喜歡跟年輕人一起，他們也喜歡和我一起。一起唱歌，一起煮飯，我很開心。有些是大陸來的，他們學生沒有湯喝，所以我煮湯包水餃。我喜歡知道你需要什麼想什麼，我幫忙。在這裡養老都辛苦的，所以能歡喜就好，有歌唱就好。
    *K: Yes, lots. They’re lively, and being with them is a good time. There’s lots to talk and laugh about. Every year on my birthday, I invite people from the concern group to celebrate. I like to be with them, and they like to be with me. It makes me happy to sing and cook together with them. Some of them are from mainland China. Most students don’t get to drink soup often, so I make some soup and dumplings. I like to know what they want and miss about home, and I like to help with that. Retirement can be a struggle, but it’s enough to be happy together, and to sing together.

Community Stewards like Sue serve as neighbourhood diplomats who help to bridge the communication gaps between business owners and homeless folks who often share the area we call Chinatown. They also help to beautify the neighbourhood and keep it safe by picking up litter and used needles. In this interview, Sue chats with Chinatown Today about her experiences taking care of Chinatown businesses as well as the folks on the streets throughout the pandemic.

    Please note this interview mentions substance use and sexual assault, which may be triggering for some readers.

    subtitle: `Embers Eastside Works`,
    content: `*CT: Can you tell us about your relation with Chinatown and how you came to work here? 

    *S: I’ve been working with Embers Eastside Works since it came into our community roughly 3 year ago. I went to an employment office to get support, and soon after started on this pilot program. 
    
    *CT: Do you have a favourite memory of being in Chinatown?
    
    *S: I remember attending the Chinatown parade about 2 years ago. I also remember the fabulous markets in the summer. It was nice because it felt like Chinatown opened up wide. Back in the 70s, my parents would bring me down to Chinatown and we’d buy our food here. 
    
    *CT: How has Chinatown changed between the 70s and now? 
    
    *S: There's been a lot of changes, especially in the last eight or nine months. It wasn’t perfect before, but I feel that things have gotten somewhat worse.  
    
    *CT: What are some of these changes in the last 8 or 9 months?
    
    *S: I work with businesses in Chinatown, so I have a connection with a lot of the storefronts. I check in with them to make sure they’re safe, see how the owners are feeling, and what our program can do better to support them. Some people have said that they are afraid. I’ve noticed a lot of Chinatown stores are locked up, closing their doors, or have given up. I don’t speak Chinese, but we give each other a thumbs up or thumbs down to see how things are going. A lot of these businesses need money to support their families, but they are getting their windows broken in. A lot of them are scared to talk to strangers or are hesitant to report problems. Last week early in the morning, I saw a woman trying to keep a door closed as three gentlemen were trying to force their way in. I spoke with the men and asked them to remove themselves. I had to deal with some language that wasn’t pleasant but they moved along. The lady was too scared to even come out to speak with me, but eventually she let me know how scared she was and thanked me. 
    
    *CT: Thank you so much for sharing and stepping in at that moment. Could you tell us what resilience means to you? 
    
    *S: We need to make Chinatown safer somehow, but it's a big problem, and I don't know how we can do it. One way I see things getting better is through handling drug addiction better. I’ve been horrified to hear about the racism towards Chinese people because of the idea that they brought COVID. But you can’t blame people for that. Nobody should get hurt or experience violence over racism, but unfortunately it is happening. Back in the 70’s, Chinatown was amazing. It was safe and people were friendly, but now people are always hesitant. Most of the people I talk to are elderly. But I think just smiling at each other or giving a thumbs up makes a big difference. 
    
    *CT: My grandparents would take me down here in the 90s and even compared to then I’ve seen so much change. 
    
    *S: Oh yeah! My mom and dad would bring me down and buy me those beautiful lamps that changed colours and had the strings coming down. As a kid I used to love that. I still do, but these days they’re hard to find, and a lot of places are closed.
    
    *CT: Apart from closures, are there ways you’ve seen or experienced the effects of COVID in Chinatown? 
    
    *S: It’s changed a lot of things for people. I believe in universal basic income. When people can get some money, they are happy because they are able to live. I think everybody has the right to a life where they have a bit of extra money to do things. When the federal government introduced CERB, everyone applied. But CERB was only for six months, and now it’s run out for a lot of people. In my observations, this has led to an increase in break-ins and crime. I used to be a part of this community at one point but now it feels like it's been taken over and it's sad. I blame the system because we deserve to be treated like people and not numbers. I’m glad I have Eastside Works. The people here are amazing, they support each and everyone one of us stewards. I was able to grow through this program. Without Eastside works I would have been something different. I know about the realities of the Downtown Eastside, because I lived it. I’m drug free. I’m alcohol free. I’m way and beyond who I thought I was and that's because of things like this program and PHS, the medical clinic on Carol street. In my lifetime, I went through a lot of challenges… So I wasn’t able to have a real job per say. When Eastside works opened, it was my opportunity to get better, to get healthier, and to get working. I’ve accomplished that because of Eastside Works and this is my family here. 
    
    *CT: It’s amazing to hear your journey in such a short period of time. Could you tell us more about the Chinatown Steward program and your time with them? 
    
    *S: We aren’t police but we do pretty good work. There’s two shifts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. We basically check in on storefronts, do garbage pick up, needle pick up, and just try to save lives. We carry Narcan and try to be well equipped to do our part to keep people safe. So even though we specifically look out for the storefronts in Chinatown, we try to look out for everyone. A couple of weeks ago my coworker and I had to deal with a pretty bad scene outside of the office here. There was a girl and we had to call the paramedics to save her, we had to explain that the poor girl had lice from head to toe. And they said that they would come when they could, a couple hours. We couldn’t wait a couple hours. This girl was going to die. So I had to run to PHS, the medical centre, and grab the nurses to get her a crash cart. Finally a doctor got on the phone with the paramedics and told them that they need to come now. Soon as they came they were shocked with the situation and weren’t very sympathetic. I knew that the girl had experienced sexual violence and they basically didn’t treat her as a person. At that time I had to take a few days off work to think about these things. So I have to give thanks to PHS, they're a great medical centre. They work with drugs and addictions and do wonderful work. I am a peer support worker with them through the portland hotel and take clients to appointments. I’ve come a long way in three years and Eastside works is and will always be my home. 
    *CT: That’s so lovely to hear. I think your journey in itself is a story of resilience and it goes to show that there many people here who come from difficult situations but given the chance and opportunities, you can turn your life around. 
    
    *S: People definitely can turn their lives around. But unfortunately, support is hard to come by. I was lucky to be one of the fortunate ones to get to know the people here at Eastside Works. Just being here makes me so happy to be alive and have people I can trust. The work has its challenges, but I’m a survivor. They’ve done so much for me.
    
    *CT: What would you say is the most challenging part about your work that people wouldn’t know? 
    
    *S: We need more outreach people. We have some but not quite enough. Right now everyone is in a bad place, mostly due to income. The government is risking our lives when they don’t help us. 
    
    *CT: Are there potential solutions or ways people can help the communities down here? 
    
    *S: I believe we need more places like Eastside Works. With COVID, it’s so hard to meet and help people. We don’t have support services and because they weren’t already in place, it's even harder to build them because of COVID. There are people who started working at the same time or before me, and they are still here. It’s sad to see that people can’t come here anymore, or have coffee, or keep warm when the winter comes. Where are these people going to go now? Last year we had a christmas party for the whole community. It was beautiful. We were all accepted. There was hot chocolate and cookies. This year that's not going to happen. I think this year we will see an increase in violence and I worry about the survival rates. 
    
    *CT: What would you want people, from outside of Chinatown and the Downtown Eastside, to know about the communities you work with? 
    
    *S: My mom and my kids are scared I might get hurt because of this profession. My family now knows there are some safety nets put in place, but they’re still worried. Wherever I work, my family will come. I have a history, I’m still fighting for justice. I’m a survivor of something really serious and I made it through thanks to the people here. We have Atira Law, down on Cordova, where they help women who have survived abuse or police brutality find advocacy and legal counsel. A lot of people in Chinatown don’t know about programs like this, because there are a lot of other resources. There’s the women's centre, which some elderly Chinese folks know about. I hope we can let more people in the community know that there is support out there. 
    
    *CT: Thank you for being so vulnerable. This is a great neighborhood but I don’t think the public hears about a lot of the difficulties people who work and live experience. You briefly mentioned the police, how have you seen policing in the neighborhood or your role in doing community policing?
    
    *S: A lot of the stores I work with say there's no use in calling the police. The police take too long to respond, and their problems get handed off to someone else. I don’t think the police are doing enough to keep people safe. Safety should be the priority, and I don’t see that happening. I understand that the police have a lot to deal with because there are bigger crimes, and they can’t be around at all times. I get that. But when people need you when they’re in trouble. You can’t let people wait for hours. 
    
    *CT: We’ve heard similar sentiments where elders are hesitant to call the police because there are cultural and language barriers. 
    
    *S: I don’t speak the Chinese language, I wish I did so I could help more, but I try my best to make them feel better. 
    
    *CT: Chinatown is definitely not just a space for Chinese people though, and I think it is important to acknowledge its historical context. 
    
    *S: The people in Chinatown have made us feel included but they’re worried and so they’re hesitant towards certain people. But to make change we need a lot of people, not just 5 or 6, you need a whole community working with the Downtown Eastside. 
    
    *CT: It’s been very heartening to hear that some of the elders we’ve talked to are really open and aware of current issues like BLM and Indigenous struggles. It feels like incrementally people are becoming more receptive to having conversations with people from outside their community. Are there ways you think we can bridge conversations between different groups? 
    
    *S: That’s a hard question. It’s the fact that there are people who aren’t receptive to having these kinds of talks and they’re the ones who are causing trouble. A lot of Chinese people are family oriented, just like I am in Italian families. We don’t like to talk about our private lives and are fine with keeping to ourselves. A lot of them just want to run their stores, but now they can’t. It’s hard.

    blurb: `Frontline workers have been critical to our individual and collective well-being throughout the pandemic. Who better to interview about the pandemic, resilience, and Chinatown, than frontline workers who operate Corning Drugs, a pharmacy located at 515 Main Street that’s been operating since 1972? David Wong and his mentor Derick Cheng chat with Chinatown Today about challenges the Chinatown business community face as a result of the pandemic, such as lack of rent subsidy and a changing client demographic. David reminds us that the pandemic is truly a global phenomenon, and that the care we give to one another can be seen through the medical masks we’ve sent, crisscrossing the Pacific, in each others’ times of need.

    subtitle: `Corning Drugs`,
    content: `*CT: Can you tell us some of your earliest memories of being in Chinatown?
    *W: I remember when I was like 6 or 7, my parents would take me to Chinatown to buy groceries. There were a lot of people on Pender Street, and on the weekends it would be bustling. It’s not the same now. My dad would take us down for breakfast on Sundays. There was this restaurant on Keefer, it's gone now, but they had a congee special that we would order. 
    *CT: It’s similar for me, and it's sad that the cha chaan tengs are gone. Even goldstone is for sale now.
    *W: I loved their egg tarts the best! But maybe you don’t have to put that in there. *laughs*
    *CT: Anecdotes are always great! What does resilience mean to you in the context of Chinatown?
    *W: To me, resilience is the ability to come back. Even though there are many setbacks, you have to fight through it and still come back everyday to serve the community. There are a lot of people here who need our help. 
    *C: We have patients coming all the way from Surrey and Richmond, as well as from East Van. 
    *CT: There are multiple Corning locations, correct?
    *W: Yes, the demand is there. The Corning on Georgia Street had started with six doctors in that building as well as a blood testing lab in the back. There was also a physiotherapist there, which would have been very convenient for the patients. It’s important to have everything easily accessible especially with the elderly population, because sometimes they have a harder time getting around. This week they finally repaved the sidewalk on Georgia, because the tree roots made it quite uneven. For us young people it's not that big of a deal, but it’s a hazard for elderly patients who aren't as agile, especially those that have eye problems like glaucoma. When they were pouring the concrete, this little old lady came in to get her eye drops and she stepped right into the wet concrete because she couldn't see it was wet cement. The city crew were upset, but they didn’t know she had eye problems. As a young person, you don’t always think about things like this. But as a pharmacist, I always have to put myself in my patients’ shoes.
    *C: Most of the staff in our pharmacies can speak different dialects, which really has its value in Chinatown. 
    *CT: In what ways has Corning felt the effects of COVID? 
    *W: The end of January was when we started feeling the effects of the pandemic. People here were scrambling to buy masks to send to their relatives in Hong Kong and China. Before COVID, we might sell 2 or 3 boxes of face masks a month at best, but in January we were selling maybe 40 or 50 boxes a day. There was a demand for hand sanitizer, too. I had to take extra time to go elsewhere to source these supplies because our wholesalers were running out. A couple months later, we had our outbreak in Canada. We put up signs and plexiglass overnight, as per regulations. There was a high demand for medication and personal protective equipment March through April, and our supplies were running low because everything halted to a stop around the world. For safety reasons, doctors started to fax or phone in prescriptions more. We started doing more deliveries as well. After work, my staff or I would personally deliver prescription medication out to our customers to ensure they’re safe. 
    *C: This is a unique situation. Chinatown merchants can respond to these emergencies because Chinatown is a community with different kinds of businesses that help each other. People come down to Chinatown for banking, doctors, groceries, chinese medicine, bookstores and all this. It was working very well because it's like a big market or shopping centre. But now the problem is they take away a lot of business from different sections in the community. So the community has been struggling. That’s also why I’ve been saying the city doesn't give enough confidence to the local population. 
    *CT: What was your biggest worry during this time? 
    *W: The COVID virus itself was of course a huge worry. There’s also been an increase in homelessness. When the city shut down during March and April, Chinatown was ghosted. We kept open so I went to work everyday, and I noticed homeless folks would sleep right on main street and outside of our pharmacy. There was a mattress fire a few stores down, and some stores got broken into. 
    *CT: What do you think are some challenges Chinatown faces and has faced in the past?
    *C: In terms of the physical space, the problem was with building codes. You couldn’t develop on Pender before, unlike on Keefer, Georgia, and Union, where the building code was more relaxed. Vision Vancouver was very good in the beginning. They listened to all these kinds of ideas, and they relaxed building codes for housing and apartments, which could go up to 12 stories, and 15 with exemptions. There are a lot of people living in poverty here, because people can’t afford to live in other places. The Merchant Association had to hire their own security guards to report about break ins and patrol at night. Chinatown Security has been around for 20 years.
    *W: They’ve been arounds for a while. But even with them, break-ins still happen because they can’t stop everything, and they’re not around every second. 
    *C: I was so involved in the community because I realized that if the community doesn’t speak out and put pressure on politicians, they won’t pay attention to issues in Chinatown. Chinatown can’t just be old buildings with height restrictions. We are near downtown so there are high taxes, and all these stores are closed down because there's no incentive for them to reopen. 
    *W: Especially for businesses in the Chinatown Plaza. It's ridiculous. Because of COVID, the government offered rent subsidies to the tenants, and it must be applied for through the landlord. But the plaza belongs to the City, and the City could not apply, even though it’s the landlord.
    *C: We can’t go back in time, and we can’t return to Chinatown in 1986. Chinatown can’t just be used for historical value, to preserve it in a way that is not modernized, sanitary, health conscious, and without security or safety. Also people's buying habits have changed. You need resources to make this place cleaner, well developed with more activities, so tourists can come down and enjoy themselves. And not try not to just have the looks. The City also tends to concentrate all the social services in Chinatown. Let's say the needle exchange, which is ok, but in the beginning they promised they were going to have more safe injection sites across the city. Chinatown already has a lot of heritage buildings and cultural spaces. It’s good to want to preserve buildings that have cultural and historical value, but that can’t be every building in Chinatown. There is also no bylaw consistency. When I first opened Corning Drugs on main street, in the next few years, there were two more drug stores next to me, even though the bylaws say you can’t have the same kind of business within 450m. When the City wants to approve something, they approve it. If not, then they will hold these public meetings and drag it out. 
    *CT: What are some ways you would like to be supported? How can the general public support local businesses in Chinatown? 
    *W: It’s important to have rent subsidies for the businesses that are trying to survive. I’m blessed because the pharmacy business is relatively stable because people always need their medication. It disheartens me seeing the businesses around us shut down and can’t come back because they don’t have any support. It horrifies me to imagine barely having enough income to pay the rent or the staff. I don’t think I’d be able to sleep. 
    *C: You have to give people hope. The city and all these groups have to look and give some hope or some immediate action that shows during this kind of emergency. We need concrete action to help the people here, and not just talk about preserving Chinatown. Policies, regulations, and guidelines need to be set out so people have confidence to endure these kinds of hard times. 
    *W: There's a stigma around Chinatown. People might come down to party on Thursday nights, but they won’t think to come to get a haircut. 
    *CT: What is something you’ve been doing throughout quarantine to keep your mental health in check?
    *W: I manage three stores, so life can get very hectic. I practice transcendental meditation to cope with the stress. It helps me a lot with everything going on. Everyone is going through similar stresses, but I don't think that everyone knows how to handle it or have the tools to do so. I think meditation is just a great way to cope. I was regularly practicing prior to COVID, and I’m very thankful for my practice. I don’t know how I’d be maintaining sanity without it. Everyone has their own way, and some people may use methods that aren't as beneficial, such as alcohol or other substances. It’s easy to think of substance users as bad people, but maybe they went through hardships, and didn't have the tools, the support, or family to help them get through it. Sometimes when you mess up once it just kind of spirals. 
    *CT: I really like that point. It's important to be empathetic and to understand that everyone has their own lived experiences and perspectives, and that we need to be mindful of where people might be coming from. Is there anything else you’d like to add?
    *C: The government keeps looking the other way. They’re not concerned about making Chinatown viable or prosperous, and they ignore our problems altogether. We want to be able to stay in Chinatown and do well, whether it be emotionally, socially, or financially, and we need help from the City.

    content: `*CT: What is your relationship to Chinatown?
    *M: I grew up running around Chinatown. When my family first came here, we lived in the building right across from the Chinese Cultural Centre, six of us in a single room on the second floor. After we moved out of Chinatown we moved to East Van, but I’d visit Chinatown all the time because my great aunt lived in the Chau Luen building. She would babysit me, even after we moved to Surrey. I spent a lot of time in the Chau Luen building and running around Chinatown. I got involved with the Chau Luen Athletic Club, took kung fu lessons when I was a teenager, and over time I got more involved. Now, I teach kung fu and lion dance at the athletic club, and I’m also a director at Chau Luen Society. Chau Luen’s most significant project is seniors’ low income housing. We have 82 homes right in Chinatown. I’m also one of the inaugural co-chairs of the Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, which is a City of Vancouver committee that’s been convened to increase collaboration amongst the Chinatown community, but also to help shape how the City of Vancouver staff, specifically the Chinatown Transformation Team, proceeds with the UNESCO World Heritage Site application. 
    *CT: What is your fondest memory of Chinatown?
    *M: My fondest memory is attending the Lunar New Year parades as a child in the audience and seeing the firecrackers. I still remember the smells. Since practicing kung fu and lion dance, I’d always been in the parade. There weren’t many years when I was in the audience, so that’s probably one of my fondest memories. I also have lots of great memories of going for dim sum in Chinatown with my great aunt. Because I was the baby of the family, she’d always spoil me. She’d always order two plates of beef rolls, one for the table, and one just for me. We used to go to a place on Pender called 龙凤茶餐厅 (Long Fung Cafe). They had sugar and creamer on the side, so you can just order regular tea, and make milk tea yourself.
    *CT: Has your perception of Chinatown changed between now and then? 
    *M: Tangibly what’s changed is the foot traffic, the feeling that Chinatown is a busy part of the city. One of the things I miss the most is the noise and sounds. Back then, when you walked down the street, the produce stores would have an uncle yelling “fresh veggies” in Toisanese or Cantonese. I miss that. There are other aspects that are still around in different ways, like lion dancing and lots of good restaurants, but I miss the sounds the most. 
    *CT: Can you tell us about your journey with lion dance and kung fu? 
    *M: When my family lived in Chinatown, we would hear the Hung Sing Athletics Club practice drumming on the floor above us. As far as noisy neighbours go, they were probably the worst, but as a kid, I thought it was amazing. My sisters still tell me about how I would throw a blanket over myself and pretend to lion dance. After we moved to Surrey, I didn’t have much opportunity to participate in kung fu or lion dancing. When I was old enough to take the skytrain, I’d attend lion dance and kung fu classes at Chau Luen. It was when I was going to university that I noticed that there were fewer people interested, because it wasn’t considered cool at the time. But our group is very passionate about it, and it’s definitely a group effort. I joke about it being Chinese guilt. No one else is around to do this, so you feel this responsibility to keep it going. Even my parents don’t always understand why we keep going. But if we don’t do it, who else is going to do it?
    *CT: What does it mean to you to carry on these traditions? What do you think it means to the greater Chinatown community?
    *M: I feel a responsibility to not only be a practitioner but to teach and promote it to the next generation. We’re very proud of the fact that we have students who started when they were six years old, and are now still practicing this unique part of our culture in their 20s. That helps to keep it going, and I’m hopeful they will continue to pass it on to the next generation as well. 
    *CT: Are there ways in which the significance of lion dance has changed for you over the past two decades?
    *M: It’s grown on me. As I get older, I gain a deeper understanding of just how special it is to be able to do it in Chinatown. Over the last few years, I’ve seen an increase in interest in Chinatown as a space, as well as in the intangible heritage here, which is comforting. There’s more participation and engagement. Lion dancing is very ceremonial and traditional. The techniques and the practice of the ceremony itself have stayed the same, but the interest is starting to change. People seem to view it differently as they understand more now about how unique it is. 
    *CT: What does resilience mean in light of the greater interest in lion dancing?
    *M: Resilience, and even in the word itself, has that character of continuing on in the face of adversity. In a lot of kung fu styles, there is a set named after the plum blossom. It’s not just martial arts organizations; a lot of Chinese societies use the plum blossom as their symbol or logo design. The plum blossom is one of the few flowers that thrives in winter amidst the snow when there’s nothing else in bloom. When we talk about resilience, I think about the plum blossom, I think about kung fu, and I think about lion dance. Resilience is being able to thrive through adversity, and it all comes together in the plum blossom. To me, it’s a trait that’s always been there in us. You just don’t really see it or understand it until someone points it out. 
    *CT: One of the big adversities in recent times is COVID, and everyone has been affected in some ways. In what ways have you seen the effects of COVID? Have your interactions with Chinatown been affected by COVID? 
    *M: It’s much more difficult to visit and maintain a connection to Chinatown. When I lived in Vancouver, I used to visit Chinatown two or three times a week. Now it’s shrunk to once or twice a month. One of the big reasons I would go to Chinatown would be to teach kung fu class. We had to pause all activity for the bulk of the pandemic, and even though we recently started holding class again, they’re not at our usual location in the Chau Luen Tower, because we need to protect the Chinese seniors who live there. I’m still doing some advocacy work throughout the pandemic, but it’s very different doing it from a distance. My wife and I still make the point to go to Chinatown to pick things up when we can, but we have to be very intentional about it. 
    *CT: Can you tell us more about the Chau Luen Society and your role with the organization?
    *M: Chau Luen is a Chinatown clan society. Most clan societies are organized around a common surname or hometown in China. Chau Luen is organized around five last names. We’ve been around for almost 80 years. We were originally located at Union and Main. In the 60s, as part of the teardown for the viaduct and policies around that time, we were forced to relocate. In 1973, we established the Chau Luen Tower as it is right now. It’s an apartment complex at Keefer and Gore, and it’s housing for low-income seniors. The Chau Luen society also has seniors’ activities, kung fu and lion dance classes, as well as a scholarship program for postsecondary students. 
    *CT: How does Luen differ from other benevolent associations?
    *M: One thing I’ve always been proud of is our focus on seniors’ housing. A lot of the other societies have SROs, which cater to low-income folks as well, but they don’t use a non-profit model for those spaces, nor do they specifically serve low income seniors. That’s always been the nearest and dearest to my heart. My great aunt, my grandfather, and my grandmother all lived there during their lifetimes, and it’s one of the biggest reasons I got involved with the society beyond the athletic club. 
    *CT: Has serving low income seniors always been the model? 
    *M: When we were displaced from Main and Union about 50 years ago, we specifically fundraised to build the Tower as apartments that are not Single Resident Occupancy rooms. Each unit has its own kitchen and bathroom so we could take care of the seniors, and give them a place that’s in Chinatown. They can still go grocery shopping and live independently with friends. I think it came out of necessity, because no other society is doing it. I’ve always been very proud of what we do for low-income seniors, and we’ve been doing it for 50 years. 
    *CT: I’ve heard at Chau Luen, lion dancers would visit each unit in the tower. 
    *M: I actually don’t know how that came about. Around Lunar New Year, we go floor to floor to visit every resident. I haven’t heard of any other lion dancing organization that does this, and I think it’s really good. Lion dancing is a blessing ceremony, and during the ceremony, you make an offering for the lion. The elders in the building would put up little candies, fruit, and sometimes a red pocket, and the lion would go door to door, kind of like Lunar New Year trick or treating. For a long time I didn’t think anything of it, but it wasn’t until someone else pointed out how unique it is that I realized it’s not done elsewhere. It’s one of those traditions that you just do, and don’t stop to ask why, because it’s so fun. We see it’s really fun for the seniors as well. Their faces always light up when we visit, and there’s one floor of seniors who are very proud of always having the most participation. 
    *CT: How do you see resilience in your role with the LSG compared when you’re doing community work with Chau Luen? 
    *M: I think it’s important to remember when you work with an organization like the LSG that the things you talk about have real impact, which we sometimes forget. It’s easier to remember what being in Chinatown feels like during meetings when you’re walking the streets all the time. Sometimes it can be hard to remember why you’re meeting when you’re debating policies and programs all day. It can happen to any of us. Being resilient on that front means remembering that the reason you’re there is so you can have a wider influence to help shape policies that will affect the people in Chinatown.
    *CT: What has been the biggest worry for you during this pandemic?
    *M: As a director at Chau Luen, my biggest concern was that the biggest outbreaks have been in assisted living facilities for seniors. Because Chau Luen is an unassisted living building, we have to take care of our residents while not having the same level of control over visitors or distancing practices as an assisted living facility.  We haven’t had any issues, and we’re proud of that. The other concern for me is the cultural legacy businesses in Chinatown that have been hit hard, and are still at risk right now. One of the campaigns I took a lead on was advocating for a bailout for Chinatown. Granville Island, which is a traditionally white neighbourhood that’s tourism based and culturally significant to Vancouver, had received $17M in federal funding separate from government funding for small businesses elsewhere. Chinatown is similar but is historically disadvantaged, and there was nothing coming for Chinatown. The potential UNESCO World Heritage Site bid is predicated on the intangible cultural heritage of Chinatown, which is the practices, the ceremonies, the day-to-day happenings of the people that live there, the businesses, arts organizations, and non-profits and societies. The architecture is only a small part of it. The intangible heritage is all the activities carried out by the people, and if these culturally appropriate legacies businesses disappear, they’re gone forever. If the practice of these greengrocers, the uncle hawking his vegetables are gone, we wouldn’t even have a chance to bid for UNESCO.
    *CT: What are some ways people outside of the community can help? 
    *M: Just go to Chinatown. Pick up some pastries. Go grocery shopping. Pick up some takeout. That’s the easiest way for someone to really help Chinatown out right now. LSG is continuing to work on larger scale approaches. One of the projects right now focuses on how to engage the city to highlight Chinatown, and to give it more support. It’s about helping people realize the danger Chinatown is in. We’ve been previously engaged with both the City and the federal government, now we’re coming up with some ground level initiatives through working to mobilize people.
    *CT: 2020 has been a garbage fire, but it also has been a year of change making. One of the bigger movements of the year has been Black Lives Matter, and some of the protests went through Chinatown. Chau Luen Society was on the same block as Hogan’s Alley Society prior to the viaduct. Can you speak on these working relationships?
    *M: The Chau Luen society was right on the corner of Main and Union. When the City decided to force the landowners out of the area to build the viaduct, we did our best to make do. Chinatown needs to do better to build stronger relationships with Hogan’s Alley. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done for all the neighbourhoods, like the Downtown Eastside and Hogan’s Alley, in terms of social programming and planning. There is also lots of work to be done with the Northeast False Creek development plan, which will impact Hogan’s Alley and Chinatown. We also need to make sure everyone who is a stakeholder in that plan is at the table during the dialogue. In the past, the broader Chinese Canadian community had stronger relationships with other racialized communities. Over time, through different factors, those relations have weakened. The Black Lives Matter movement gives our community an opportunity to have an important dialogue about racism with an inward gaze. It’s hard to have that conversation with another community when you yourself don’t recognize what’s happening to them, as well as the role you have played in these happenings yourself.
    *CT: Are there specific ways in which the Chinatown community can support other racialized folks, whether it be in the Black Lives Matter movement, or when it comes to policing in the Downtown Eastside?
    *M: I think people need to become more educated about how police treat different marginalized communities differently. Black and Indigenous communities are overrepresented in police statistics. There’s a significant number of folks in the Chinatown community who advocate for the safety and security of our neighbourhood, and the go-to answer is always “we need more police on the street to make people feel comfortable enough to come down to Chinatown”. But policing isn’t the best way to address the situation, though it’s the easiest to say. The hard questions are how do we treat mental illness? How do we treat drug addiction? What about homelessness? How do we attack the cause rather than the symptom? That, to me, is how you address it. It can’t just be displacing the issue from one neighbourhood to another. We need to actually fix it. Sometimes I think people perceive a divide between Chinatown and some of the other communities, but it’s important to think about how that wasn’t always the case, or might not be the case. The way that I see it, and a lot of the elders tell me so as well, Chinatown was just the catch-all name. It wasn’t just Chinese people living there. Chinatown was a space for basically everyone who wasn’t white, and who were marginalized. We need to break down barriers and preconceived notions that we’re separate communities, when historically that hasn’t been the case. When we speak of the communities inside Chinatown, we’re also speaking about the Japanese and Filipino communities. The Hindustan Times, a very well-known newspaper, operated out of Chinatown. Even the Italian community, now well-known, didn’t start on Commercial Drive; they started in Chinatown. 
    *CT: Now more than ever is an important time when people are hurting and need different forms of aid. Are there different ways in which you think external communities can help these further marginalized groups other than going down to support, given the physical barriers COVID has created?
    *M: The starting point, other than walking the streets with your feet, is for people to educate themselves. That’s a big one in really understanding what relationships those neighbourhoods have. From what I’ve seen, the City has been very intentional about doing something significant for the Hogan’s Alley community. As someone from Chinatown and not from Hogan’s Alley, there is at least some attempt, whether it’s through literature, or the Northeast False Creek Plan, at calling the area Hogan’s Alley. I don’t know how significant that is, but it’s a start. I don’t know if these issues are necessarily on the provincial or federal governments’ radar, but the recognition of the broader groups and communities that have been here is something that needs to be continuously talked about.

    extra: `Chau Luen’s Core Conditioning Corner
    Everyone always focuses on stretching, but often overlooks strengthening. An apple a day might keep the doctor away, but three minutes of planking a day will help to keep the back pain away!
    Start with a regular plank. Lie facedown on the ground, and prop yourself up on your elbows, placed shoulder width apart, such that your upper arm is perpendicular to the ground. Brace your core as if preparing yourself for a sucker punch to the gut. Your body should taper down from your shoulders to your heels in a straight line, or as straight as possible. Imagine you are a ramp, and Popo is walking up and down the length of your body while pushing a cart full of groceries. Hold still. You want Popo to be safe! Plank for three one-minute sets throughout the day. If your body isn’t used to this kind of work, it’s okay; time is an abstraction anyway. Just hold your plank for as long as you’re capable of, and continue to test your own limits.
    When you’ve gained some strength and stability, and the challenge of the regular plank no longer makes you sweat profusely with anxiety, try the rotating plank. Start in the regular plank position. Perform a side plank by rotating your torso to the left so your body weight comes to rest on your left elbow, while your right arm goes straight up in the air like a shark fin looking for a high five. Hold this position for a count of three, then rotate your torso back to the right so the movement is mirrored on your right side. Move through these rotations for the duration of a minute. Think about the meaning of life and about all the cool shops you can visit in Chinatown while you rotate through your plank.`

    subtitle: `Bamboo Village`,
    content: `*CT: What is your relationship with Chinatown?
    *K: I came to Canada to marry my husband. I’ve been here for 30 years. My husband’s family has been running businesses since they arrived in Canada. During that time, a lot of immigrants from Asia ran their own businesses because, like my in-laws, they didn’t speak English and couldn’t find jobs. A lot of people of that generation would run laundromats, or chop suey, or grocery stores, to make a living and to raise a family. My in-laws first ran a grocery store in Surrey. During that time, the big stores had short hours and didn’t open on weekends or holidays, which created a golden opportunity for Asian store owners whose stores were open everyday for long hours. Growing up, my husband would finish closing up around midnight, eat dinner after closing, and wake up early the next morning for school. They never got enough sleep, but that’s how they got by. Then after a couple of years, my in-laws started businesses in Chinatown. They were the first generation to do business in Chinatown, and we are the second to carry on the business.
    *CT: How long have you been working in Chinatown?
    *K: I’ve been working in Chinatown for 30 years, and it’s been over 40 years for my husband. 
    *CT: During this time, how have you seen Chinatown change?
    *CT: It’s changed a lot. I came in the 90s, which was during Chinatown’s golden period, from the 1986 Expo onwards. During that period, there were a lot of immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan. It was around the time Hong Kong was returned to China, so a lot of people were moving here. A lot of these immigrants only brought a few suitcases with them. They needed to buy everything in Canada, so business was really good. My in-laws had a few different stores in Chinatown. They had an herbal store, a kitchenware store, and my brother-in-law ran a Chinese handicraft store. We sold whatever the immigrants needed. As time went by, the immigrant demographics changed, and international shipping became easier. The Chinese population in Vancouver diversified. In the past, if someone wanted to buy Asian groceries, they had to go to Chinatown, because that was the only choice. As the city developed, and as demand increased, it is now possible to buy Asian groceries in bigger stores, like Safeway and Superstore. There’s not a need to go to Chinatown anymore. Chinatown isn’t what it was during the golden period, but I think that’s part of the normal process. 
    *CT: Do you have a favourite memory in Chinatown?
    *K: I loved Chinatown in the 90s. When people came to Chinatown, they had a purpose, and they were prepared to spend money. The stores were always packed. Stuff would sell fast as long as you had stuff to sell, and customers had to wait until the next shipment to come in to buy things they wanted. The profit margin 30 years ago was much higher than nowadays. A pound of ginkgo 30 years ago was over $10, but now it’s pretty much the same price. There was so much traffic, which created a very exciting atmosphere. I miss that atmosphere. It’s changed.
    *CT: Why do you continue to be part of the Chinatown community?
    *K: We had a comfortable life during the golden period because business was good. By the time my in-laws retired, they asked us if we wanted to take over their businesses. Instead of taking over the herbal store and kitchenware store, we decided to run a furniture and handicrafts store. Even though business isn’t as good as it was before, it was still good enough for us. We want to get out of our comfort zone, but the more years we stay in Chinatown, the harder it was to try to make a change. My husband and I are close to retirement age, so we plan to wait for another couple of years. Doing business means you’re always going to face risks. At our age, a loss would affect our retirement. If I had another chance, I would run a business in another location.
    [insert Tray’s “Resilience is when the difficulties of survival become mundane” here]
    *CT: Once you retire, what do you think will happen with Bamboo Village? Do you plan to pass it to your children? 
    *K: I’ve never thought about my kids taking over. Even if they wanted to, I would tell them not to. My in-laws’ generation decided to go into business because they couldn’t find a job to make a living. But for my children’s generation, as long as they can find a stable job, they can be independent. Running a business is a lot of pressure, much more than a job where you only work for eight hours. If the phone rings at night, my heart races, because I don’t know if it’ll be the security company telling me someone’s broken into my store. That kind of pressure is always there. Why not choose an easy life?
    *CT: Is there anything positive about running Bamboo Village that has kept you in the Chinatown community?
    *K: We sell lots of plants now. Sometimes I talk to people who tell me how much they like seeing the plants. They tell me our store makes Chinatown beautiful, and that we’re doing a good job. I’m very happy when I hear these comments, because people see the effort we put into making the environment more beautiful. I really appreciate it when passerbys look at us this way. 
    *CT: Your store really is beautiful. The inside is like a little forest, a little escape. Can you tell us a bit about how it came to be this way? How did you make the transition to where the store is now?
    *K: Originally, we ran a store selling handicrafts and furniture. My father in-law noticed there were no stores in Chinatown that sold bamboo goods. He went to China with my husband to search for bamboo products. At the beginning, we sold bamboo furniture. Then we kept adding more bamboo-related things. I also learn new things from customers everyday. Besides furniture, customers asked for Asian antique furniture, which we added to our products. Then they asked for other oriental antique items, so we added those as well. There is always a trend, but trends never last long. That’s why we keep changing, and we keep listening to the customers to see what they’re looking for. A couple of years ago, business was in bad shape. My husband suggested that we try selling flowers, so we started with just one shopping cart of flowers. It didn’t sell very well, but it added enough income that we expanded more and more. Before the pandemic, we decided we were going to change our store to have more gardening-related products. We had a plan already, but everything about the pandemic was unexpected, and we didn’t know what would happen after the reopening. We opened a couple of hours a week in June by appointment, but every time we have an appointment, we get other customers who want to come in. We realized that there are suddenly more young people interested in plants. We learned from customers that it’s because people want their homes to look nice when they’re on video calls, since they’re working from home. This really opened up my eyes. Customers are willing to show me pictures of popular plants they’re looking for, and they’re willing to spend lots of money to buy them. There are even auctions. I’m not very interested in social media, but I ask my daughters to show me what’s popular on social media so I can keep up with what customers are interested in. My kids also suggested creating a website for the store so we can expand our client base to keep the business going. I get my kids to help me with the website, and we are learning how to do it, too.
    *CT: How have your clients changed throughout the years, and throughout the pandemic? 
    *K: It’s changed to a different age group. Because we used to sell temple offering paper, we had more middle-aged and older clients who were mostly Chinese. Many years ago, we decided that we were going to phase out this type of merchandise. Because of the pandemic, people now mostly shop online unless it’s items that you need to see in person. For plants, for example, it’s better to touch them and pick the one you want, because the one you see in a photo and the one you get shipped to you are different. Since the pandemic, the majority of our sales are from plants or plant-related products. That’s why our clients have shifted to 20 to 40 year-olds. Some of our customers post about our store on social media, and the exposure brings us more business. I think having returning customers is really important, too. Making money is important, but you have to think about the future. I can’t just sell you something today, because business is long-term. You can’t only look at the right now. You really have to put your heart into your career to think about the future.
    *CT: How has COVID changed your business?
    *K: It’s made it faster. Even before the pandemic, we planned to change over our store, but we were doing it slowly, because change involves lots of work. The pandemic has forced us to change as soon as possible in order to survive. When you get inquiries, if you cannot bring back the answer right away, people will go elsewhere. We have to respond fast, and put more energy into it than before. Before, there was always tomorrow, but now, we have to do it right away in order to survive. So many businesses closed because of the pandemic, and it’s sad to see. 
    *CT: How do you think the pandemic will affect Chinatown or how you operate Bamboo Village?
    *K: Even without the pandemic, Chinatown has been changing. My daughter tells me Chinatown became a hipster town a while ago. The world is changing. You can’t change the world, so you have to change yourself to adapt to this world. People are coming to do business in Chinatown because the location is very convenient. Compared with other neighbourhoods like Gastown or downtown, the rent is much cheaper. People see the opportunities, so if you can’t keep up, you have to get out. Once you get out, new people will come in. I think that’s normal. I appreciate new businesses coming in. They bring in new concepts and new customers. When the new generation dines out, they will look online for good places. New businesses put a lot of effort into social media. Even though the quality of the food is just regular, the point is the food is instagram-worthy. As long as it tastes okay, it’s good enough. What matters is when you post pictures of it, it looks cool. We’re not the type of customer these businesses will aim at. We’re practical. These new businesses can survive because they are aiming at the right market. I appreciate these new businesses because they come in and make Chinatown more active.
    *CT: Do you see this as a problem in some ways? When new businesses come in, they make the rent higher, so a lot of the older businesses can’t survive, especially during COVID. I was really sad to hear that Goldstone bakery is closing.
    *K: I’ve been going to Goldstone for years, and I feel sad, too, but nothing lasts forever. No matter how good you are, when you pass to the next generation, the upkeep is hard. A restaurant has many people working there. In order to support a big restaurant like that, you must have good business. It’s not an easy job. For a restaurant to close at 10 PM, most likely there’s still lots of clean up to do after closing. When you’re losing money every month, you’d rather just cut your losses right away. Whether a glass is half empty or half full depends on your perspective. That’s why when I look at it from this angle, it’s good that someone else is taking over the business. 
    *CT: COVID has been difficult for everyone, especially for local businesses. What are some ways you feel like people can support Chinatown?
    *K: We can’t rely on others to solve our own problems. But when people pass by, and they tell me they appreciate the work I do, it gives me more passion to keep doing even better. Chinatown has an image issue. When new businesses come to Chinatown, new customers will come. Unless homelessness is solved as a problem in Chinatown, the golden period won’t be back.
    *CT: What does resilience mean to you?
    *K: For me, resilience means nothing lasts forever. You have to equip yourself, improve yourself, upgrade yourself, in order to face the changes. You have to anticipate what’s going to happen in the future and plan out your next step. Even though you see so many restaurants close down, new ones will always take over. You never know when the next pandemic will come. People always think a war will crash the economy. But you don’t need a war or any weapons for it to happen. No matter how well you prepare, things happen. Just wait until it comes. Then you see what’s happening, and you deal with it.

    content: `*CT: Can you tell us about your relationship to Vancouver’s Chinatown?
    *M: Yeah, my relationship with Chinatown began when I was a young child. I grew up in Langley, but when I was a kid, my dad would take us to Chinatown to get dim sum. We’d go to Maxim’s and go to the traditional Chinese medicine shops. Now I live and work here. I learned over the last couple of years that my grandfather actually owned a shop in Chinatown. He’s now passed, but from the photographs, it looks like the shop was around in the late 70s, early 80s. It was across from Sun Yat Sen gardens, where it opens to the cultural center there. 
    *CT: What kind of shop was it?
    *M: I think it was a Chinese curio gift shop. My dad used to joke that he would swindle white folks, sell it to them at a higher price. You know, Chinese pottery and tell them that they were antique? 
    *CT: The hustle never stops. Do you have a favourite memory of being in Chinatown?
    *S: One of my favorite memories in Chinatown was last year when Paul Wong gave us an entire hall to create an exhibit to showcase the different ways the members of House of Rice represent our cultures. Dol had a table in the middle practicing Thai calligraphy where people could join and learn; Jas Minh was at the entrance serving jasmine tea for everyone; Pangolin was painting MaryKol so everyone could see the process of getting into drag; and Kara was fan dancing. Every hour, we would go to the pagoda and put on a freestyle performance. I think it was really beautiful way of adding queer life into the Sun Yat Sen gardens. Maiden couldn’t make it because she had another event, but we put a dress on a little mannequin to represent her.
    *M: To represent my ghost. My favourite memory is doing Pride in Chinatown. I was invited along with Rose Butch to do a contemporary play on gender that was contrasted against Cantonese opera, which was a really cool experience. We went to one of the performers’ homes and got to see their process, a lot of their life story, their costuming techniques, and all of their literature around the subject. Paul Wong wanted to include a series of self portraits I took in Pride in Chinatown, and these were printed on vinyl posters and plastered throughout Chinatown. My boyfriend was with me as we were going around. He is also mixed Chinese, but he doesn't have a lot of connection to Chinatown besides now living here. As we went around, I told him memories from my childhood that are linked to the different establishments and places I had been. I had this moment where I thought, “Oh, I'm taking the active role that my dad had done for me now with my partner in Chinatown.” It was spooky to come into yourself like that. 
    *CT: I love that, it's amazing. How do you feel that your interaction with the community or the spaces in Chinatown has changed from your first interactions to now?
    *M: It’s silly because when I went to Chinatown with my dad as a kid, I would think we were going to China. Looking back, that was just the most obvious way of understanding the cultural exchange as a kid, because Chinatown felt like a very removed space. Now I’m part of this space, and I see the same people on the street everyday. It’s also important to acknowledge that Chinatown sits on the edge of the Downtown Eastside. This space is the site of very complex relationships and histories, and me living here is a part of these relationships as well as patterns of gentrification. I was manager at a queer venue just outside Chinatown before COVID and was laid off work. I'm not working besides doing art, and I've been put into a position now where I'm very much never leaving the community and the neighbourhood. I’ve stayed within the bounds of Chinatown for the most part during the last six months. As an artist who’s starting out and trying to bring identity politics to drag, I felt like an outsider even to my own culture. A lot of things that I’ve been exploring with my drag are things that I didn't really get exposed to as a kid in a mixed household. I think because I’m so immersed in Chinatown now, I'm beginning to feel more like a member of the community. 
    *S: I’ve travelled a lot, and I always find comfort in Chinatowns everywhere I go, especially because of the food. When I first came to Vancouver Chinatown it felt intimidating to come into Chinatown, because there weren’t a lot of shops open. I don’t know if it’s because I feel more comfortable in the space now, or if there's a growth in the number of shops, but now the intimidation is completely gone and I come to Chinatown quite often. At the beginning of the year, I was starting to work in the studio and be in Chinatown a lot more, but since COVID, I haven't been able to come out of here as much, especially because I’m a full-time frontline worker. A lot of my free time was spent self-isolating and on self-care because I’m in contact with a lot of customers. I didn't want to risk bringing that to Kendall, so I kind of had to pull myself away and separate myself from Chinatown for a while. 
    *CT: It’s interesting you mention feeling intimidated at first. It’s something we’ve heard from some other folks as well, along with varying thoughts on policing in proximity to the downtown eastside. Do you have any thoughts on the implications of safety and community policing for your respective bubbles?
    *S: I had to unpack a lot of those thoughts and presumptions about what the Downtown Eastside was before I was able to be more comfortable in this space. But I don’t know if I’m around enough to witness the policing around. 
    *M: Police presence has shifted pretty dramatically over the past few months, and I think it might be related to the skyrocketing number of overdose cases. There’s an astronomical number of people who are affected by the opioid crisis, and there is a lack of support from our government. I think the increase in police presence in the area is compounded because on top of the stigma around drug use in the Downtown Eastside, some folks are acting differently because they’re using new drugs that they don’t normally use. As a result, more people are calling the police, which leads to increased police presence in an already overpoliced area, and the police aren’t doing much. You end up with this huge police presence that's very intimidating to everyone here to solve a problem that can’t be solved by more police. 
    *CT: What does resilience mean to you?
    *S: I feel like I've always had a resilient attitude. I always approach problems with the goal to make it work, regardless of the situation. The end goal is just to be happy.  This year's been crazy but I think there have been some positive outcomes. I feel like the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn't have been as strong if everyone was still busy working. Because of the pandemic, people had free time to go to these rallies and push for change. In a sense, this virus is indirectly helping the world heal because a lot of people are being held accountable for their actions.
    [insert still of Shay, “end your racism”]
    *M: Resilience to me is knowing what your boundaries and limits are, but not seeing those as an impasse. My dad would always say if you're not happy doing something, there's no point in continually pushing yourself up against it. At the end of the day, while those successes might benefit you or your loved ones along the way, you're not going to be satisfied at the end of the day. I think a big part of resilience is knowing what the end goal is, and what are the things that you don't want to do. This means knowing yourself enough to change your narrative from “I'm incapable of doing that” to “I don't want to do that”, or “it doesn't feel good to me.”
    *CT: As people of colour who are not Black or Indigenous with studio space in what used to be Hogan’s Alley, how do you participate in conversations while being an ally?
    *M: It starts with being mindful about the space you're taking up. There's so much of queer culture that borrows or steals from black culture, and it’s important to acknowledge that. It’s also important to reflect on who you surround yourself with. Recently, when I've been contacted for gigs, I’ve been doing more research about how an organization is set up, and whether they have only white people on their boards. It's mind blowing sometimes, especially when there aren’t any people of colour in positions of power, even when it's an advocacy group whose mandate is for the uplifting and sharing of stories of people of colour.
    *S: Make sure you're listening to Black people and doing what they have said they need you to do. Just because you’re doing something with good intention and because everyone else is doing it doesn’t mean it’s helpful. Be aware of our position as allies, but make sure to ask and to listen to the right people.
    *M: I also think for people who have the means, it’s important to redistribute their resources. There are so many organizations and places you can donate your money to. 
    *CT: Are there activities or practices that are helping you with your mental health and working through 2020?
    *M: Making art has been really nice. Also not being on news feeds for a few hours a day was really nice. 
    *S: When drag started moving online, I did a couple of numbers that were addressing racism against Asians because of Coronavirus. Having those big shows that people are viewing from all over the world and hearing comments definitely helped sustain my mental health for a little while. Having the in Rice-solation show where I got to work with all the members of the family for the upcoming Up in the Air rEvolver Festival really helps with my mental health because I was able to connect with the family that I created but haven't seen in months because of the lockdown. Little things like that, work, and also seeing Maiden. Keeping those connections, knowing our boundaries, and accepting the fact that should anything happen, none of this is our fault. I’m thankful for being able to connect with friends and family that I trust and love.
    *CT: What has been your biggest worry during 2020?
    *S: When this all first started happening, I was really worried financially because I was working in a queer performance and bar venue. I had stopped working a few weeks before the mandated shutdown, so I was already sort of broke, and now I'm not working at all. This was before CERB. I was doing some online shows, and people were really generous with their donations. Then it became clear just how serious COVID is. It’s funny how my brain was wired to think money is more important than my body. Then, in June, it was seeing the Black Lives Matter protests gain momentum with the murders of George Floyd and Brianna Taylor. Now I think my biggest concern is the election coming up in the United States, as well as the BC provincial election. The political state of the world feels so much more precarious than it ever has. In Chinatown, too, we've really been trying to support local businesses, because we’re seeing people close their doors. All urban organizations and fabrics just seem to be so precarious.
    *S: The biggest concern for me is my family in Ontario. I saw my newborn niece for the first time in August briefly last year and in December for Christmas. My other sister just gave birth in June, and I haven't been able to see her and I don't know if there's a chance for me to go back. At the beginning of COVID I was taking it very lightly. I thought I'm still working, it's fine, things are gonna be fine.Then when I was walking to work, I noticed local businesses closed down. And it started to hit me that it might be a long time before I get to see my sisters. And if anything was to happen over there with my sisters, or my parents or anything, am I just going to be stuck here hearing the news, but not being able to do anything about it? That day on my walk to work, I started crying. Reality just hit me really hard at that point. 
    *CT: What have you learned about yourself during these really difficult times?
    *M: I've been doing a lot of internal work and self-reflection. And recently, I think, a week or two ago, I vocalized and came out as trans to some close friends. 
    *CT: Congratulations!
    *M: So that's been like a big focal point, I think of my literal transformation. But like Van was saying, there are elements of the virus experience that have been a bit of a gift. Before COVID, I spent so much time working that I didn’t have time to spend just with myself. Now it's the inverse, and I’m finally able to confront all these things that I’ve been processing since I was a kid but have never actually looked at in the face for what they are. So I'm able to love that about myself.
    *CT: Congratulations I'm so happy for you. Do you think that drag is inherently political?
    M + *C: Oh, yeah, sure. Absolutely. 
    *CT: What is a message that you want to ultimately convey with your art?
    *S: It changes with what's going on in the world and in our lives. When the Orlando Pulse shooting happened I did a candlelight performance to honor all the people that had died. When something happens that we feel we need to address, then we come up with numbers for that. Our aesthetics and our drag personas are also very political because queer Asians are underrepresented, and us being doing what we do is just creating visibility and increasing representation for the people who need to see it.
    [insert Shay, “I am not a virus”]
    
    *M: Yeah, It's not so much there's an obligation to do a drag number that's political, because queer spaces are so inherently political. I think it's important not to divorce the political or deeply critical thinking from party spaces. I've always seen our drag as being that waypoint. Like, hold up. There are terrible things happening.
    *S: Yeah, acknowledge it, be aware, think about it, and then keep dancing.
    *CT: It's probably more difficult to do a drag show or to hold these types of spaces now, but are there ways that you are doing drag right now? 
    *M: I think we're both on a little bit of a performance break. I’ve done a few fundraisers where the fee is going to an organization. In that way it's manifesting the messages and commentaries on what's happening right now that I've been putting into my work. I did a number reciting Mark Aguahar’s “Litanies to My Heavenly Brown Body”, which was very important to me. I think the yellowing of bodies is a further division from browness in how I conceive those things. I think making art that sparks difficult conversations has been important to me. 
    *S: I’m Vietnamese and South East Asian, which is separate from East Asian. I have darker skin, and growing up, I’ve always been under the impression that having darker skin is just not what’s desirable, while having lighter skin is. Darker skin means you’re poor and your family is working class and you’re in the farm lands. I really had to learn to deconstruct and unlearn that over the last little while. It’s been impactful, and it’s something I talked about in In Rice-olation as well. I think it's an important conversation that comes from that Aguahar poem. 
    *CT: Maiden, you were featured in the film Yellow Peri*L: Queer Destiny. What are your thoughts around the term yellow peril, as it pertains to Chinatown?
    *M: This virus has brought an upsurge of anti-Asian racism. The model minority myth has real implications in the world especially in North America, but it doesn’t protect you from being perceived as yellow eril. This yellow peril sentiment can be turned on at any time, and if you are in a certain space, there is so much rhetoric that can be used against you regardless of how much material possessions, land, or success you’ve accumulated, because of the white lens.
    *CT: How does bridging these intersections of queerness and cultural identity translate to resilience or manifests as resilience? 
    *M: I think it was really exciting that these last few Pride in Chinatown events were in public and very visible spaces. The queering of Chinatown in a formalized event is quite new. I think of resilience in this context as being mindful of the fact that queer people have existed in Chinatown forever, and that queer people have existed forever. Theres so much to think about with regards to queer ancestors and queer people who exist in these spaces. I think it’s important that there are people like Paul Wong, who fights for that existence by bringing young artists like ourselves into the space to participate and to teach us how to have the tools to do this work and to show other people that we exist. 
    *S: I think it’s also important to realize that even though there is so much racism right now, it isn’t the worst that’s happened. Queer and Asian communities have both persevered and survived for long enough that we’ve been able to be ourselves and make space for ourselves. As a demographic, we have gone through racism, we’ve gone through the hate, we’ve gone through the struggles. Maybe it seems like it's been taken away momentarily, but we’ll get back. It’s not the end of the world, as much as it might seem like it. 
    *M: It seems like it *laughs*
    *CT: Was important to you to have these events specifically at Sun Yat Sen garden, and in Chinatown? What does that mean to you to have your studio in Chinatown? 
    *M: It’s important to me. I think Sun Yat Sen Garden is a beautiful space that has very scholarly connotations, so having this queer opera and queer House of Rice immerisive drag experience in this space goes back to our earlier conversation about not divorcing queer political experiences from academia or a party sphere. It’s really about blending those things together. 
    *S: We don’t live one note lives. 
    *M: Yeah. We have to adapt in different spaces, but you’re not a queer person who works at Sun Yat Sen gardens who doesn’t experience any radical queerness because you work for Sun Yat Sen Garden, you know? You have so many various capacities and I think it’s important to have a space where you can be all of them at the same time. 
    *S:  It’s about being able to see the representation of all our identities in one space, rather than feeling like you have to reserve parts of your identity for certain spaces and certain times. Obviously timing and space are important, but when its not detrimental to the space, it’s important to add a different element to it so we can explore everyone's identities in a safe way. Just knowing that we could bring our queer selves to the Sun Yat Sen Gardens and to Chinatown was an important experience. 
    *M: Having a studio here and living here has been really meaningful to me on a psychological and emotional level, because I get to practice what I do in this neighborhood. In a lot of ways I’m really grateful that I ended up here because my dad used to take me here, and that's part of my history.
    *CT: Maiden, your drag artistry recontextualizes Cantonese opera by translating it into a new medium. What are your thoughts on what it means to recontextualize an art form from your own culture?
    *M: It’s something I’ve been talking about throughout my whole drag career. On one hand, I hesitate to claim it because I haven’t studied Cantonese opera. But on the other hand, there is so much of it that is part of my story, and part of who I am. It’s not like I’ve done zero work to understand Cantonese opera. I think it’s important to introduce those things to a wider audience and to contextualize them because I think the queerness of it has always existed. I don’t think I’m doing anything revolutionary.  
    [Insert Maiden Instagram photo]
    
    *S: I think it’s about reframing it. It’s taking what we know as our culture, and putting it in a different form that’s exciting to the audience now. If the traditions stay the same, and we’re not presenting it to audiences in our own way, it's never going to reach who we want it to reach. I think of it as trying to bring awareness to our cultures so that people are more interested in learning about them.
    *M: The commodification of culture is a huge topic. I think while it’s important to ask what your intentions are behind doing something a certain way, the effect of your intention is out of your control once you put it out into the world. I’ve had to get used to the idea of relinquishing the control over how people will perceive what I’m doing. I’ve had people criticize what I do as being disrespectful because I don’t practice opera or lion dancing. Cultural practices are very sacred to people, and that is so valid. The criticism upset me at the time because it was really not what we were trying to do, but it has really informed my decisions since. It’s become a part of every conversation I have with myself when I’m doing something new. 
    *S: Checking these boxes is a fine balance, because if we were trying to follow a more traditional route, we would never have queer lion dancing and trying to bring women and fem people into the practice, which is traditionally not allowed. We need to balance respect for tradition while at the same time break barriers so we can include everyone. 
    [insert Shay, “I work on the frontline”]
    
    *CT: speaking of intent and audience, who is your audience?
    *M: I’m creating my art for gender variant people. I think that’s at the heart of who I want to create work for because that’s how I see myself, and stuff like this was missing in a lot of art that I was consuming as a kid and throughout university. There’s such an under-representation of queer Asians from all cultures. So when I do what I do, especially when its culturally informed, I’m thinking of those people who have never seen work like this on a stage, especially in a white space, or people who think they could never do something like this because of the way their families talk about queer people.
    *S: I’m trying to create to show people that drag is not so scary. There's space for authenticity in it for you to be yourself and explore all parts of yourself, and you don’t have to follow these social norms of your parents or traditions. That's an audience that I tend to target. 
    [insert Shay intro shot]
    
    *CT:  I wanted to revisit the question of resilience, since we’ve spoken about a spectrum of things, and what that means to you or has that changed? 
    
    *M: Because the conversation has been contextualized by community, geography and space, a big part of resilience relies on community. There's so much we can do together as opposed to alone. And how much the success of individuals relies on the success of your group or your pod. Whatever that might be. I know that even if I have an individual struggle, my ancestors, with me going through this transition and who are my trans chinese ancestors and who are those people. I think a big part of resilience is knowing that struggle across different times and space is really important. 
    *CT: Another thing we’ve been doing is asking out interviewees if there's an activity, recipe, or practice you’ve been doing to help you get through quarantine? 
    *M: It’s maybe not an activity per say but getting through this has been acknowledging taking a nap is a good thing to do for yourself and its ok. Making art and not thinking about it as a commodity to sell to someone has been really useful. Like oh I can make things and there's no like contract, there's no deadline. No ones going to pay me for this necessarily. Doing it has been amazing. This new thing called doing things for yourself. 
    *S: I think also just on the connections you need and can connect with. When pride was cancelled but I booked off pride week and that was very healing to be together on this special day we’re supposed to have. Still making that effort. 
    *M: Recipe wise, I’ve been cooking a lot, cooking a lot of new stuff. But a constant has been getting like dim sum from newtown and having that on hand all the time. Or just going to newtown to get a taro turnover. Go support your local businesses.

    *L: My name is Li Yu Rong. I came to Canada in 2004, and I’ve been here for more than 10 years. I’ve liked this place from the beginning. The air is fresh here, and there’s fewer people. The environment is very good. I like the environment in Canada. It’s not too cold, and not too hot, and there are flowers and gardens everywhere. It’s safe and clean.
    
    I：您听到唐人街这个词会想到什么？
    *CT: What do you think about when you hear the term Chinatown?
    
    L：我原来在美树堂住，就来唐人街买东西。我那时候我看见唐人街和我们中国的街道上，小巷里头是一模一样的。我就非常感慨，他们把中国的东西都搬到这里来了。买东西的时候，粮油这么的比中国卖的还全。豆腐呀，炸酱呀，什么都有。日升卖的菜和中国的是一模一样的，还新鲜，人还少，又卫生。中国人多，新鲜东西来了很快就抢光了。
    *L: When I used to live in Maple Ridge, I’d come to Chinatown to do my shopping. At that time, I remember thinking how similar the streets of Chinatown are to streets in China. I had so many feeling*S: they transported all these Chinese things here! When I buy groceries, the staples  I can find here have even more variety than in China. There’s tofu, cooking sauces, everything. The produce sold in Sun Rise is exactly the same as in China, and even fresher, more sanitary. There are so many people in China that when anything good and fresh are supplied, they’re gone in minutes.
    
    I：您是中国哪里来的？
    *CT: Which part of China are you from?
    
    L：我家乡是山东青岛的。我是青岛人。在青岛环境卫生也还不错，但比不上这里。毕竟人少。

    I：对您来说，唐人街意味着什么？
    *CT: What does Chinatown mean to you?
    
    L：唐人街就是意味着华人的文化发展。我们华人来到这里，广东人讲广东话没有变样。讲国语的来这儿讲国语也没有变样。我们带着我们的华人的文化来唐人街。唐人的文化在加拿大没有改变。我在这里不懂英语照样可以和华人交流。我觉得这要感谢先移民的华裔们，感谢他们为我们在加拿大创造了这么好的条件让我们来可以在这里生活。
    *L: Chinatown signifies the cultural development of the Chinese diaspora. When the Chinese come here, those who speak Cantonese still speak Cantonese, and those who speak Mandarin still speak Mandarin. We brought our Chinese culture to Chinatown, and that hasn’t changed, even in Canada. I can’t speak English, but I can still communicate with the Chinese people here. I am deeply grateful to the first generations of Chinese diaspora. It’s thanks to them that we have such good living opportunities in Canada.
    
    I：这里好多华人讲的都是广东话，您听得懂吗？
    *CT: A lot of Chinese folks here speak Cantonese, but you speak Mandarin. Are there communication issues?
    
    L：我是和他们相处的惯了。我们会说你好，她会叫我到她家里坐坐。这些我和楼里的老人都能交流。但是要是说的很多了我就听不懂了。她说广东话，我说国语。我也能猜她说了什么，也能了解。这和英语不一样。要讲英语我就根本不动了。
    *L: We’re used to being with each other. We’ll say hello, and they would signal for me to visit with her in her home. I can communicate simply with a lot of the elders in my building, but if they speak too much or too fast, then I can’t understand them. They speak Cantonese, I speak Mandarin. But I can still guess what she’s saying, and I can understand that way. This is different from English. I can’t understand English at all.
    
    I：您生活在唐人街最开心的回忆是什么？
    *CT: What’s your happiest memory in Chinatown?
    
    L：最开心的回忆就是可以跟同龄的人相处。我住本拿比和美树堂的时候没有同龄的家乡人可以聚一聚，聊个天，说个话。在这里，我很开心有同龄的老太太可以谈家常。比如说，你跟谁来的，你家儿子几个孩子，你姑娘在哪里啦，国内还有孩子吗？就是唠家常，什么都说。在这儿生活的习惯吗？在家里每天做什么饭啊？就是老太太的话。虽然只是一些老太太的话，可是我在这里找到这么多人跟我有共同语言。但是和广东人讲话只能是你好，再见。没有人讲话是一件很孤独的事情，也不开心，会想家。我有段时间我有想回去，住两年就回中国半年。现在不是了。
    *L: My happiest memory is just being able to be around people my own age. When I lived in Burnaby and Maple Ridge, I didn’t have anyone with the same language background who I could get together with, to chat with. But here, I’m happy to have old ladies my age to talk about our daily lives. For example, who did you come to Canada with? How many kids do you have? Where is your daughter? Do you still have kids in China? It’s just everyday conversation, we talk about everything. Have you gotten used to living here? What do you cook everyday? It’s old lady talk. But even though it’s only old lady talk, I’m so glad I found so many people with the same language. When I speak with Cantonese folks, it’s limited to hello and goodbye. Having nobody to talk with is a very lonely thing. I wouldn’t be happy and would be homesick. There was a period while I was here when I would live here for two years and live in China for six months and alternate that way. Not anymore.
    
    I：您在唐人街最早的记忆是什么？
    *CT: What’s your oldest memory in Chinatown?
    
    *L:我在唐人街的第一印象是2006年。2006年市政府要来拆唐人街。唐人街一进大门从Georgia上了桥，两边都是买东西的。到西边盖了一些高楼。那个时候西边有卖叉烧肉，卖叉烧包的，都是吃的。市政府把那里都拆掉了。后来来了些年轻人，他们都是早期移民的后代。他们帮助我们做翻译，很好。我们去市政府开会，都是他们帮我们翻译。后来市政府老是来唐人街开会。他们要拆唐人街的房子，我们不让他们拆。他们要号召老百姓拆房子，买房子，不让你在这里住了。他们要用唐人街地盘盖高楼。好多人都搬走了。叉烧肉也搬走了。那叉烧肉可好了，我们经常去唐人街买来吃。现在没有了。后来就是这些年轻人来反对。唐人街是我们唐人的，用我们唐人的劳动来建立了这个地方。这里本来有水的，华人把它建平了，弄好了，在这里居住。华人的粮，油，吃的菜，只要是华人吃的东西，这里都有。唐人街不能拆。当年老人和年轻人都在一起开会，讨论到底让不让他们拆。后来这些年轻人不让他们拆。那时候唐人街住的是穷人，华人和原住居民。原住居民是最受歧视的。华人在这里要叫人头税也是受歧视的。当时原住民也起来反对。
    *L: My first memory of Chinatown was 2006 when the City wanted to takedown buildings in Chinatown. When you first get into Chinatown from Georgia Street, there used to be shops on either side. Now there are tall buildings to the west, condos at Main and Keefer. Back then the shops used to sell barbeque pork, and barbeque pork buns and other foods. The city tore it all down. Then some Chinese youths came to help. They were descendents of the early Chinese diaspora. They helped us translate when we spoke to government officials. It was great. We attended meetings with the city government and depended on them to translate for us. The city kept having meetings about Chinatown. They wanted to tear down the houses and buildings, and we didn’t let them. They wanted residents to tear down their homes, sell their homes, because the government didn’t want people to live here anymore. They wanted to use the space to build condos. Lots of people moved away. The barbeque pork shop also moved away. Their barbeque pork was very very good, we would often go all the way to Chinatown from Maple Ridge to buy it. But it’s gone. Chinatown is ours. Chinatown was built on the labour and toil of the Chinese diaspora. There used to be water here, but the early Chinese settlers made it livable. Culturally appropriate staples and groceries can all be found here. You can’t tear down Chinatown. That year, the elders and the youths all came together to discuss whether we should let them tear down Chinatown. The young generation didn’t allow them to tear it down. At that time, Chinatown was inhabited by the poor, Chinese and Indigenous alike. Indigenous folks are the most oppressed. The Chinese were also oppressed with tactics like the Chinese Head Tax, and the Indigenous helped to oppose the oppression.
    
    I：对您来说韧性这个词意味着什么？
    *CT: What does the term resilience mean to you?
    
    L：我们的先辈就是有韧性的，他们不怕困难，不怕艰苦。要交人头税那时候，修铁路的时候，死了那么多人，政府都不记录谁死了，连名字都不记，我们都忍耐下来，总有一天我们会有自己的权利。那时候我们开会就有个老太太，她的爸爸，爷爷，就是修太平洋铁路的。我是在唐人街关注组的组员。他们要拆唐人街，我们就说还我唐人街。
    *L: Those who came before us had resilience. They weren’t afraid of challenges and hardship. When they had to pay the Head Tax, when they were building the railroad, so many people died, and the government didn’t even write down the names of the deceased. They endured it, knowing that one day we will have rights. Resilience was when we met with the Vancouver city government, we had an elder whose father and grandfather worked on the railroad. I’m a member of Chinatown Concern Group. They want to tear down Chinatown, so we say give us back our Chinatown.
    
    I：您对无形文化遗产这个词什么看法？或说，在唐人街有什么文化遗产是非物质文化遗产？
    *CT: What do you think of the term intangible heritage? What is intangible heritage in Chinatown?
    
    L：非物质文化指的就是指艺术方面的文化。唐人街的华人历史在温哥华没有第二个。唐人街的耍龙舞狮啊，热闹啊，挂红灯笼啊。现在唐人街灯笼挂的少了。都是他们那次来拆房子的关系。原来唐人街灯笼是一串儿一串儿的，从上到下，还有贴着春联，可好了，看起来就是过年的样子。没钱都像过年的样子。这就是我们加拿大华裔的文化。在中国，家家户户过年都会挂灯笼，也就无所谓了。但在唐人街就独一无二，所以好多人会来唐人街。我有朋友住在列治文，都会来这里逛街，买点家乡的东西。
    *L: Intangible heritage has to do with arts and culture. There’s no other Chinatown that carries Chinese diasporic history in Vancouver. There’s lion dancing here, and strings of red lanterns. It’s the atmosphere. But now there are fewer red lanterns in Chinatown. It’s related to when they came to tear down buildings. Chinatown used to have strings and strings of red lanterns, from top to bottom, and places would have spring couplets on their doors for Lunar New Year. Even if you didn’t have money or the resources it felt like lunar new year. That’s Chinese diasporic culture in Canada. Around lunar new year, every household in China would have lanterns, so it’s very common. But Chinatown is the only place that would have lanterns, so lots of people would come visit. Even my friends who live in Richmond would come do their shopping, to buy things from back home.
    
    I：每次逢年过节就特别看得出来华人文化。在新冠肺炎这段时间里来，您觉得您最大的压力和忧虑是什么？
    *CT: Chinese heritage and cultural practices are certainly more visible during celebrations. What has been your biggest worry throughout the pandemic?
    
    L：一开始唐人街的菜站关了，我觉得有点压力。我住的地方离唐人街菜站用不了五分钟就到了，可以吃的比较新鲜。什么油菜呀，菠菜呀，今天买了今天中午就吃了。可是那时候唐人街关闭了，就只好出门买好多菜放在那，不开门。后来隔了一个来月，日升就开放了。日升一开就好了，我带上口罩去买菜，反正我出门就带口罩。我不让我家先生出来。
    *L: At the beginning, I was worried because the grocery stores in Chinatown were closed. My apartment is less than five minutes’ walk from the grocery store, so we can eat fresh produce. Whether it’s you choy or spinach, I could buy it and immediately cook it for lunch. But when Chinatown was shut down, I had to go to shops that were further to buy lots of produce at once and not go out as often. After a month, Sun Rise Market reopened, so I’d put on my mask and go shopping. Whenever I go out I wear a mask. I leave my husband at home.
    
    I：您这么护着他
    *CT: You must spoil him
    
    L：他不愿带口罩，他说戴口罩憋气。我就让他在家里看电视。
    *L: He doesn’t like wearing a mask, he says he can’t breathe. So I leave him at home to watch TV.
    
    I：这段时间里，您对您的生活和社会有什么感触吗？
    *CT: During this time, have you had any reflections on your life and society?
    
    *L:政府有从食物银行供应食物。我吃面包还可以，喝牛奶不行。我是山东人，我喜欢吃干的东西，面包还可以吃。煎饼和豆腐是我家乡经常吃的食物。
    *L: The government has been distributing food through the food bank. I can eat the bread, but I can’t drink milk. I'm from Shandong, so I like foods that are dry. Bread is okay. Chinese pancakes and tofu are the usual fare in my hometown.
    
    I：煎饼好吃啊！您自己做煎饼吗？
    *CT: I Chinese pancakes are delicious! Do you know how to make them?
    
    L：我不会。我的妈妈可会做了。我会吃，不会做。
    *L: I can’t. But my mom made them really well. I know how to eat them, but not make them.
    
    I：我也是会吃不会做。我就是吃货一个。您知道最近有很多关于黑人人权运动的游行抗议吗？
    *CT: Me too. I’m the designated rice bucket. Have you heard about the recent Black Lives Matter protests?
    
    L：知道。美国欺压黑人。我们都知道，都支持。现你们这些会讲英语的知识分子，但是一开始从中国来的华裔很多没有文化。应为中国以前是很穷的国家，所以华人先辈受尽的白人的歧视。他们歧视黑人，让黑人当奴隶，然后把他赶出来。华人在这里受歧视交人头税是最卑鄙的手段，连小孩也要交。我们就把他们欺负华人的事记到心里头。现在国家是人都要平等，这样歧视不讲理。美国歧视黑人就是这种手段，把他们赶出去，应为他们肤色不一样。我们反对应为黑人应该有权利的。联合国都给他们权利，有个人生活权利，为什么不给他们平等呢？我们都支持他。
    
    *L: I know. America oppresses Black people. We all know, and we all support Black folks. A lot of you young folks are intellectuals, but in the beginning, lots of Chinese settlers weren’t so educated. Because China was a country in poverty, the early Chinese settlers faced all kinds of discrimination from white people. They discriminated against Black people, made them slaves, then drove them out. Making the Chinese pay the Head Tax was despicable; even children weren’t spared. But we remember. Everybody should be equal, and discrimination is unreasonable. White American discrimination against Black people uses the same tactics, just because their skin colour is different. We oppose their racism because Black people have rights, too. The United Nations gives them their rights to live and to be, so why aren’t they being treated equally? We all support Black people.
    
    I：您认为华人是怎么可以支持黑人人权活动呢？
    *CT: How do you think Chinese settlers can support Black Lives Matter?
    
    L：游行，到大街上喊口号，游行。打倒美国侵略者，还我人权。这两天是关注多，但是应为关闭了，我们没法去游行。在疫情之前我们都游行。
    *L: By protesting, and shouting slogans and protesting. Down with American invaders, return my human rights. There’s been lots of attention [on Black Lives Matter] these past few days, but because of quarantine, we can’t go out to protest. Before the pandemic, we’d all go to these protests.
    
    I：唐人街虽然叫唐人街，但是这里的居民来自很多不同的文化背景。您对此是怎么看待的？您认为黑人人权运动和这些居民有什么关系？
    *CT: Even though Chinatown is called Chinatown, it’s always been a place for folks from all kinds of cultural backgrounds. What are your thoughts on this? How do you think Black Lives Matter is relevant to these different folks?
    
    L：我们是同样在这个多元文化环境里生活的。华人以前困难，现在已经翻了身了。加拿大政府已经道歉了，我们人权都有了。可是政府还没有跟黑人道歉。应为一个人和你面色不一样就欺负他是不对的。他也是人。是人就不能欺负人。我去的妇女中心就是在原住民社区。唐人街以前的时候，我们的前辈在这里修铁路。他们和原住民一起修的，一起被白人压迫。原住民和我们是好朋友。那时候帮助华人很多。他们自己也不富裕，但是他也帮助华人。在要叫人头税的时候，有的人交不起，被白人逼着走。那时候原住居民就知道华人能干，聪明。他们知道如果华人被赶走了，就没有人帮他了。他们就拿出房子和吃的来给华人，让住在他家，吃在他家，再去赚钱。
    *L: We all live in the same environment. Early Chinese settlers faced difficulties, but we overcame. The Canadian government has apologized to the community, and we have human rights. But the government hasn’t apologized to Black people. It’s not right to bully someone just because their skin is a different colour than yours. They are people, too. If you’re a person, then you shouldn’t bully other people. The women’s centre I go to is in the Downtown Eastside. When the first generations of Chinese settlers were working on the railroad, they were working alongside Indigenous people, and were equally oppressed by white people. We’re good friends with Indigenous people. Back then, they helped the Chinese a lot. They didn’t have a lot of resources either, but they helped the Chinese. When the Chinese had to pay the Head Tax, those who couldn’t afford it were forced to leave. But the Indigenous peoples knew the Chinese were smart and hardworking. They knew that if the Chinese were chased out, there would be nobody to help them. So they shared their homes and food with the Chinese, so they had a place to stay when they weren’t working.
    
    I：现在的疫情为很多人造成了不便。您觉得大家能如何帮助您和其他的长辈们？
    *CT: The pandemic has caused a lot of inconvenience for lots of people. How can we help you and other elders?
    
    L：我们很感谢社区的这些年轻人。他们有帮助我们很多，给老人们做饭，送饭送上门，还打电话问候。社区里的年轻人可乐意帮助我们了，我觉得照顾的可好了。我可感谢这些年轻人了。他们会说，奶奶，您需要什么就说，我们就是来帮助您的。听到他们的问候也很欣慰。
    *L: We are very thankful for the youth of the community. They’ve helped us lots, making meals for us, delivering them to our doors, and even phoning us to check in. These community youths are so willing to help us, and I feel so well taken care of. I’m so thankful for them. They would say, popo, if you need anything, we’re here to help you. It warms my heart to just receive these calls. 
    
    I：敬老也算是一种中华文化。您说这段时间有年轻人给您送菜吗？
    *CT: Respecting elders can be considered a kind of Chinese culture, too. Have these youths been delivering groceries to you during these times?
    
    L：这是世代同行会送的，我们这一个楼上都是他们送的。可好了，有卫生又干净的菜，可新鲜了。
    *L: They’re from the Yarrow Intergenerational Society. They deliver to my entire building. It’s great, the produce is sanitary, clean, and very fresh.
    
    I：您如果可以和这些义工们说话，您会说什么？
    *CT: What would you say to these volunteers if you had the chance?
    
    L：我会谢谢他们。我非常感谢这些年轻人，这些义工。每次给我们送的饭菜都很照顾我们的口味。送来的饭我们都吃好几天，味道都不变。我们非常感谢你们。我们这些日子的生活就靠你们关注。我们吃的也好，有菜有肉，什么都有。有一个王小姐，她经常打电话来。我们好几个人都很感谢她的关怀。
    *L: I would thank them. I’m so thankful for these youths and volunteers. Everytime they deliver meals and groceries, they’re always considerate of the kinds of foods we like. We can eat the meals they deliver for a few days, and it would still taste good. We’re so thankful for them. Our lives during these times are made better because of your attention and care. We eat well because of you, have produce and meats, and everything else.I’m always touched to receive check in phone calls. There’s a Mx. Wong, who always phones many of us. We’re all so thankful for her care.
    
    I：那我们问题都问完了。您有什么总结的话您想说吗？
    I： That’s the last of our questions. Do you have any summarizing comments you would like to make?
    
    L：现在有好多人没有房子住，是我应该关注的事情，是我们大家都应该关注的事情。
    *L: There are lots of people without housing. This is something I care about, and is something everyone should be concerned about.

    blurb: `Pearl Low is an Academy Award-winning queer Afro-Asian storyboard artist, comic artist, and illustrator. Born and raised on the Eastside of Vancouver, Pearl’s art is consciously rooted in themes of self-love, acceptance, culture, and race. Earlier this year, Pearl added muralist to her long list of artistic accomplishments. Her piece titled <em>Precious Fruit</em> on Davie Street is a pop of colour and warmth in an otherwise white space. Chinatown Today sat down with Pearl to talk about her evolving relationship with Chinatown and Chineseness, being Black in Vancouver, and why it’s so important for her to highlight Black joy in daily existence. Read on to find out what Pearl has to say about the role of storytelling, and the importance of seeing ourselves represented in the media we consume.

    title: `Pearl Low`,
    content: `*CT: What’s your relationship to Chinatown like?
    *P: I have grandparents who live just outside of Chinatown, so when I visited them, we would often run errands, eat lunch, or have dim sum in Chinatown. When I was younger, my grandma would always take me to the night market. I stopped going for a while when I moved to Burnaby, but I started getting involved and reintegrating myself into the community when I first noticed the effects of gentrification in Chinatown three or four years ago. I’ve had a childhood connection with Chinatown, but I’m also reconnecting intentionally as an adult. 
    *CT: How do you find yourself relating to Chinatown differently as a child versus now as an adult?
    *P: I still look at Chinatown with a lot of wonder. As a kid, I thought of Chinatown as a super cool place with a lot of energy. I just wanted to eat and touch everything. I still have the same feelings, but I think my engagement now is more sophisticated, and a little heavier emotionally. It feels like time is more of the essence. Now, I want to enjoy being in Chinatown, but also participate in shaping its future. 
    *CT: Do you have a favourite memory of being in Chinatown?
    *P: My favourite childhood memory was running errands in Chinatown with my grandmother. Depending on what time we left in the day, sometimes we would catch the night market. We would go up Pender Street, and I would want everything in the cool stalls. I remember begging my grandmother for this Hello Kitty fan I really wanted. She bought it for me, and I was so happy. My Cantonese isn’t that great, but I remember feeling really connected with her at the moment. As an adult, I recently took a Saturday Cantonese course at the Wong association building. It was really fun to learn Cantonese, then go out and apply your knowledge while visiting the different shops around Chinatown. For example, we had a lesson on tea, then we went to a tea shop where we learned about tea, introduced ourselves to the owner, and learned about Chinatown at the same time. That’s a nice memory for me.
    *CT: How do you navigate being Chinese, Black, and queer while in Chinatown? 
    *P: I’ve been through different phases of relating and fitting into the Chinese community and Chinatown community that I belong to. As a child, barriers and expectations were different. Because I was always with my grandparents, I felt very integrated. As I got older and into my teens, I faced a lot of resistance, where people would tell me I’m not really Chinese because I’m not Chinese passing. I felt a lot of disconnect with the neighbourhood, with the Cantonese language, and with Chinese Canadianness in general. Now I feel like I’m a bit more welcomed in. Sometimes I still do feel alienated in these spaces. 
    *CT: For me, there’s always the juxtaposition of not having the language even though I look like I should fit in those spaces or look like I should feel the same connection to others who do have language. It’s a weird feeling to navigate.
    *P: Totally. I feel like I was heavily influenced by Cantonese culture. I spoke the language at home, and I do a lot of things that are pretty “Chinese”, but I’m missing language fluency and the obvious visual of being Chinese-passing. Some of my East Asian friends who don’t have as much connection to Chinatown will have an easier time integrating into the community and be accepted immediately just because they look the part. I’m not afforded that immediate acceptance all the time. It’s an interesting space to navigate.
    *CT: Why is it important for people of colour to be represented in the media?
    *P: My relationship with visibility, especially in Vancouver, is being hyper-visible while being invisible at the same time. We’ve all seen that one Disney film that’s supposedly made for everybody, but feels so generic and therefore doesn’t resonate with anybody. It’s extremely important to have our world reflected in the media we consume, because the more specific a story is, the more relatable it becomes. That’s the role of storytelling, to learn about each other, to expand our perspectives, and to transport ourselves outside of our own world. I want us to keep expanding and pushing for other narratives to be at the forefront of things. We don’t lose anything by hearing about someone else’s lived experience. You can have the same story of a girl falling in love, but with different cultural variants and implications, it becomes a different story. We’re all telling the same story in slightly different ways. I think it’s exciting, and I want to see more different things!
    *CT: Are there ways you see your art, or art in general as a form of resilience? 
    *P: First of all, being an artist is already something that North American society doesn’t support. I’m always told I’m going to be a starving artist. People are already telling you you’re not going to be very successful, so being an artist is already a form of resilience. Secondly, being a Black woman in the city, and talking about how my perspective has been excluded in the city for so long, is something that’s doubly resilient. Resilience is existing and valuing my perspective, and trying to tell my stories. It’s taken me awhile to get to this place. It’s really easy to not want to share your perspective because you don’t think it’ll be heard. Sometimes I think about how people are going to relate to my work. But I’ve learned that there’s space for everybody’s story, and that my story is part of the collective story. I’ve been trying to internalize that more, and make sure I end up saying what I want to say when I create art. People benefit from hearing my experiences in the same way I benefit from hearing their lived experience, too. 
    *CT: Is there a particular reason why you like the children’s genre?
    *P: I think it’s an often underestimated category for content. People forget how smart kids are, and how much they take in. I think it’s crucial to introduce them to all sorts of perspectives, especially now, when we’re having more conversations around POC representation in the media. I’m biased because I love cartoons, but kids’ stories can be thought-provoking even for adults. I just hopped onto Craig of the Creek with Cartoon Network. This show is very fun because there are so many different types of characters and stories told from various perspectives. There’s just so much that can be imagined and explored with the children’s genre. 
    *CT: Do you find it challenging to work with larger studios for shows that have an all-white cast, or all heteronormative characters where it might be very different from your lived experiences?
    *P: A lot of the shows I worked on earlier in my career would have a single Black character who looks and acts exactly like the white characters, but with tanned skin, and none of it resonated with me. I try to bring as much of myself as I can within circumstances to projects. I like storyboarding because it’s in the earlier stages of animation. I get to work closely with the director and the script, and it’s easier to influence decisions on how characters might speak or act. It’s refreshing when there’s more than one Black person on the team. Authenticity will come through, depending on who you hire for a project. It really does matter! It’s taken me awhile, but now I’m in a position where the people I work with value my input and collaborative work. When I’m drawing a frame, I purposefully make sure the girl and non-binary characters exit the screen first, so it’s not always the boys leading a group out. Children pick up on it, so I really make sure I try to do that whenever I can.
    *CT: What has it taken for you to get to this point where you’re able to influence these decisions?
    *P: In 2019, which feels like so long ago, I wanted to quit the animation industry. I felt as if I were just a pair of drawing hands, hired to carry out the director’s vision, even though I wanted to get into animation so I can provide creative input for story aspects. I felt like I wasn’t being heard. That’s when I started exploring comics, where I could do my own storytelling, and see if I can forge a new path in that industry. In 2019, I was distributing my comic Tension in stores and online. The co-director of Hair Love ended up reading Tension, and he reached out to me to see if I was free. Hair Love was a cartoon short produced by Sony Animation, and it was my foot in the door to the LA industry. That was my first experience working on a project that was telling a story I cared about, and had characters that look like me. From that point on, I worked towards making connections and getting myself into the LA animation industry. I’m now working with more Black creatives than I have ever worked with in my entire life, and it’s refreshing because in these spaces, I can exercise my opinion and perspective much more than before. I feel very privileged, even though it shouldn’t be a privilege to bring your whole self to a project. I had to metaphorically leave Vancouver to find what was good for me.
    *CT: What are your thoughts on the connection between art and gentrification?
    *P: Beautification is such a weird thing, because who is it for, and who is it done by? I just painted my mural on Davie Street, and I left. It’s not a community I belong to, and I don’t personally hang out there. It’s queer, but it’s also super white. I feel like it’s the same thing with a lot of art that’s found in other communities. I don’t like the idea of street art being there because white people wanted it there. I want people to be able to see Indigenous street art, and I don’t want to be centering white perspectives in that conversation. Art is not just white. Art is for everybody. It is sad to see gentrification leaning into “beautifying” a neighbourhood, and to see folks associate whiteness with street art, but that pattern exists. It’s also a question of visibility. A lot of murals seem to pop up magically, but you don’t get to see who made it. You don’t get to see the process, and the only person who’s visibly attached to the artwork is the white shop owner on whose wall the mural is painted. I don’t know how to shift that conversation, but it’s interesting.
    *CT: Are there ways in which your art intersects with Chinatown, or is culturally specific?
    *P: I haven’t been doing too many pieces surrounding Chinatown, but I do try to use my platform as much as I can to loop the community in. Chinatown Pretty just came out. I love it, and I very happily posted about it on social media. I also just talk a lot about popos (grandmas) on Twitter, and I draw a lot of comics with my grandma in them. I talk a lot about my experience with her and the language that binds us, which ends up looping in the Chinatown experience. I hope my artwork makes people circle back around to the community again, as a reminder that we’re still here.
    *CT: Chinatown has a reputation of being a predominantly Chinese neighbourhood, but a lot of other folks also make Chinatown their home or frequent the area. What do you think Chinatown means now to folks who are not ethnically Chinese? 
    *P: I think it means advocating for communities whose space you occupy. I always feel salty about how white supremacists created Chinatown to prevent Chinese people from moving elsewhere in the city, but now Chinese seniors are being kicked out of this area that was supposedly created for us because they didn't want us around. I think businesses that are in Chinatown but whose services and products don’t cater to the Chinatown communities, per se, need to reexamine the way they occupy the space. They need to bring the conversation around to how they can centre engaging with the community. If these conversations aren’t being had, then you’re part of the problem. I know not everyone’s going to step into this role, but this is a huge part of allyship, and allyship is hard work for the rest of your days.  I’m also thinking about people who live in Chinatown, but who don’t do their shopping in Chinatown. A community is a whole ecosystem, and I feel like you should participate in that, and want to help the community grow. Gentrification is modern colonization. It’s displacing people by forcefully making them leave because they can no longer afford to live in an area anymore. In Chinatown specifically, so many grocery stores have gone, and food security is one of the first things that makes a community thrive. You shouldn’t occupy a space if you don’t care about the community there. It’s important to recognize that your actions have a ripple effect on the community. You may not know about these effects, but it’s important to be self-aware and to learn about your own impact.
    *CT:  What do you think are some ways people can support these communities?
    *P: For me, a huge part is financial support, especially from businesses that aren’t native to Chinatown. It would be cool if restaurants in Chinatown could host lunch for seniors, make lunch boxes, or offer free coffee or tea with a bun to those who have been in these communities for a long time as a way of giving back. I feel like Vancouver has an interesting struggle with cultivating community, where we tend to stay in our cultural enclaves. People will say Vancouver is multicultural, but I don’t feel like people individually mingle outside of their own respective communities. What are these elders going to do? They don’t have the language, they don’t have the same resources as other folks who also occupy Chinatown. That’s a gap that needs to be bridged. I just want white people to try. It might be exhausting to you at first because the work is new, but it pushes you to exercise empathy in a way you’ve never had to before. That’s what it’s all about. That’s what growth is. 
    *CT: It’s one of those things where if it’s easy, you’re  probably not doing enough. I find that even as an East Asian person, I constantly need to check my privilege, especially with Chinatown. When we think of Chinatown as a community, it’s so much more intersectional than what we make it out to be. Do you have thoughts on the current relationship between Chinatown and Hogan’s Alley and the difficulties of facilitating conversations between different communities?
    *P: It’s a conversation that we need to have in different ways. There tends to be a narrative where if one community can pull themselves up by the bootstraps, other communities should be able to do the same. But not every community experiences the same form of oppression, which means they don’t benefit from the same form of help. I think a lot of inter-community support can be built around one community filling space where the other lacks, but this support should be built around asking people from the community what they need without assuming you know what they are. It’s hard to navigate. I think the constant amplification of one another’s voices is important, but that will look different for everyone and for every community. It’s about visibility and cultivating spaces where we could feature different voices or different communities coming together. This mingling needs to happen more.
    *CT: The Black Lives Matter movement gained huge momentum during the past few months, and it’s heartening to finally see this amplification of Black voices. In what ways has the Black Lives Matter movement impacted your daily life?
    *P: I’ve actually had a really fruitful 2020. I feel like every Black person and their mom is being contacted by employers who are scrambling to hire Black talent. I’ve seen these patterns before. I hope people get to take advantage of this and see that our foundation has never been stable, and that we need to rebuild a new one from scratch. I feel like we need to actually fix the system this time, instead of just slapping on band-aid solutions. Everybody, but especially white people, need to realize that it takes a lifetime of unpacking and relearning to recreate a foundation. It takes intentionally building bridges and including Black folks to close that large gap between us and whatever everyone else has access to. It’s weird to be both excited about new opportunities and to be heartbroken all the time because we’re faced with Black death and Black tragedy. It’s an emotional rollercoaster ride that I’m on, and a lot of other Black folks are on, too. Your Black friend is trying to be okay through all of this. We’re trying to go to work as if it’s normal, we’re trying to find joy in these moments. We’re doing a lot of stuff, while also trying to vocalize what we’ve been saying all along, over and over again, to the rest of the world. It’s been a fruitful time for me, but in a time of turmoil. 
    *CT: I think that really speaks to your ideas that it’s important to have that sense of joy. Being a person of colour means you have your 9 to 5 job, but you also have your 24/7 job of unpaid emotional labour. There’s this weird contestation between wanting to ask another person of colour about their lived experiences, but needing to understand that it takes labour for them to share that with you. It’s not their job to explain their lived experiences to you. You spoke about how companies are scrambling to hire Black talent. Do you have thoughts on how to further remove these barriers? 
    *P: It’s the responsibility of white people in positions of power to hire other people of colour in positions of power, because you need to have people of colour at all levels, including the very top. I’ve heard white people say in meetings that they don't want to hire people of colour for the sake of tokenization, but they don’t realize it’s only tokenizing if you’re hiring them for the sake of them being people of colour. An excuse I hear a lot in Vancouver is that it’s hard to find Black applicants. But if your intention is truly to hire Black folks, the solution is to search for them in unconventional ways. You need to think outside the box. You never know what you’ll find on Twitter. There are so many other avenues you can explore for finding talent, but you have to put in the effort, and you have to reach for these people and ask them to apply. Sometimes white people will say people of colour “don’t have the right qualifications”. But these qualifications cost so much money, and the schools that offer these qualifications aren’t looking to accept people of colour to begin with. But just because someone didn’t take these specific courses doesn’t mean they don’t have equivalent experiences, or that they have any less potential in doing this job well. Mentorship is really important, too. It’s about investing in people of colour and bridging the gap. I’ve heard people say that investing in people of colour is an unfair advantage, but they don’t realize society has given white people the unfair advantage. It only seems unfair and like a lot of work because that’s the difference between what you’ve been given versus what we’ve been given.
    *CT: When people say there aren’t a lot of Black folks in Vancouver, the question they need to be asking is why aren’t there a lot of Black folks here, and it’s because the government intentionally put a highway through the one Black community in Vancouver and forcibly removed those people. 
    *P: That goes back to looking at certain communities and not using a one-size-fits-all approach. You can’t be trying to reach out to Black folks in the same way you’d reach out to Chinese folks. There are so many Chinese people here that statistically you’ll just get more applicants. You have to think a bit more critically, and try to think of other ways to reach out to these communities in different ways, because every community requires a different approach. 
    *CT: What was your biggest fear throughout the pandemic and the quarantine, and what do you do to get through it?
    *P: Loss of connection was a huge fear of mine. Even though I’m really close with my grandparents, they’re elderly, and I didn’t want to expose them to the virus. That was hard for me. I’ve also had to seek out hobbies. I’ve been trying to become a plant mom. It has been really nice, just getting to take care of something green. One thing I thought about a lot during the pandemic is how life seems so short, and you might as well do something that makes you happy, just because you never know what’s going to come at you within a week. During these times, everything changes by the day. Now I’m more intentional about what I take into my day, who I interact with, and just what I feed into my life experience. That’s how I’ve been coping.
    *CT: What does resilience mean to you?
    *P: My identity has a lot of intersections, and I feel like my entire existence is resilience. I’m Black, I’m queer, I’m an artist, and resilience to me means being my most authentic self. Resilience is creating and maintaining space in the face of white supremacy, which can look different for every community, because different communities need different support. It's also about helping others hold space for themselves. We exist and move through the world in different capacities, and I think that’s important to recognize when talking about resilience.
    *CT: You talked about resilience as existing and working through white supremacy and colonial practices. What does that look like in your daily practice?
    *P: I think my practice has more firmly centred Black joy, especially in these times, catalyzed by the George Floyd incident. We’re faced with a lot of Black suffering. It’s part of the conversation, but it’s not the only part of the conversation. I think a part of resilience that needs to be mentioned is joy, because the function of racism is to not allow racialized folks to be happy and live our lives. Racism creates distractions to bring you down, so it’s very important to make sure you still find moments of joy. That’s what I try to do in my practice and in my storytelling. I want to remind folks how joyful our communities are, whether it’s Black communities, or Asian communities. We’re not just marginalized folks who are suffering. We have happy moments, too, and we have things to celebrate.
